add_depth5
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Extend the recursion depth options to include depth=5, allowing exploration of deeper recursive patterns which may boost the FirstFit/ω ratio at the expense of a larger instance.
</DESCRIPTION>

<DIFF>

=======
    depths = [3, 4, 5]  # include depth=5 for more aggressive recursion

<NAME>
expand_offset_templates
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Add additional offset template variants (3,7,11,15) and (0,4,8,12) to explore more branching geometries and potentially improve FirstFit pressure across varied spatial tilings.

<NAME>
restrict_extra_first_to_root
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Modify extra_first behavior to add the extra copy only at the top recursion level (lvl==0) rather than every level, concentrating branching at the root to better manage clique growth deeper down.

<NAME>
increase_waves_small_length
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Increase the augmentation wave budget to 120 and force wave_length=1 to exploit smallest interval injections for maximal FirstFit pressure without growing the clique.
</DESCRIPTION>

<DIFF>
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    max_waves = 60  # keep moderate

    # ensure wave_length at least 2 for stability if space allows
    wave_length = max(1, min(3, wave_length))

    max_waves = 120  # increased wave budget for finer augmentation
    wave_length = 1  # always use minimal wave length to maximize FF pressure

<NAME>
increase_candidate_limit
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Expand the wave augmentation search by raising the candidates_limit to 2000, allowing more potential insertion positions to be evaluated each wave iteration.
