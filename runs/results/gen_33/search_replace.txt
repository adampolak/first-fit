alternating_blocker_schedule
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Introduce an alternating schedule for inserting the long "blocker" intervals: on even iterations append blockers after the copies (as before), but on odd iterations prepend blockers before the copies. This variation in arrival order can increase the pressure on FirstFit by altering the overlap structure dynamically, potentially improving the FirstFit/ω ratio.
