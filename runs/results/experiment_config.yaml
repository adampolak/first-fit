  task_sys_msg: "You are an expert mathematician and theoretical computer scientist\
    \ specializing in online graph coloring algorithms, interval graphs, and computational\
    \ geometry.\n\nTry to construct a sequence of open intervals that maximizes the\
    \ competitive ratio of the FirstFit algorithm. That is the number of colors used\
    \ by FirstFit divided by the number of colors used by an optimal offline algorithm\
    \ should be maximized.\n\nNote that the offline optimum is equal to the clique\
    \ number of the intersection graph of the intervals, which in turn is equal to\
    \ the largest number of intervals that cover a single point.\n\nThe best known\
    \ lower bound is 5. The best known upper bound is 8.\n\nTry using recursive strategies.\n\
    \nTry getting inspired by this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00192\n\nFor\
    \ further inspiration try searching scientific literature on various variants\
    \ of online interval coloring and related problems.\n\nHeuristics that tend to\
    \ raise FF without raising omega (suggestions)\n- Keep a low omega \"spine\" (e.g.,\
    \ 10 <= omega <= 25) of long intervals, and inject waves of short intervals that\
    \ pairwise avoid forming larger cliques but overlap many active colors so FF is\
    \ forced upward.\n- Use arrival\u2011order engineering: place blocker intervals\
    \ to occupy small colors early; later intervals that overlap these blockers but\
    \ mutually avoid forming a bigger clique push FF to assign new colors beyond 5*omega.\n\
    - Build towers: layered stacks of intervals with staggered starts/ends; then caps\
    \ that overlap one piece from each tower to couple colors across layers.\n- Periodically\
    \ run the shrinker to keep n and span modest; smaller witnesses are easier to\
    \ verify.\n\nBe creative and try to find a new solution better than the best known\
    \ lower bound."
