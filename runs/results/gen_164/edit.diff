 def construct_intervals(iterations: int = 4):
   """
   Construct a sequence of intervals of real line,
   in the order in which they are presented to FirstFit,
   so that it maximizes the number of colors used by FirstFit
   divided by the maximum number of intervals that cover a single point
 
-  The initial implementation uses the construction from
-  Figure 4 in https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00192
+  The variant cycles through four canonical copy patterns across iterations
+  to increase adversarial diversity while preserving omega.
+  Patterns (per-iteration) are:
+  A: (2, 6, 10, 14)
+  B: (1, 5, 9, 13)
+  C: (3, 7, 11, 15)
+  D: (0, 4, 8, 12)
+  The cycle repeats every four iterations.
 
   Returns:
     intervals: list of tuples, each tuple (l, r) represents an open interval from l to r
