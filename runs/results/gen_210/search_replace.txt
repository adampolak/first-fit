add_half_step_pattern_and_six_blocker
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Introduce a new half‐step offset pattern (`alt_c = (1.5,5.5,9.5,13.5)`) to diversify interval placements and enrich the adversary’s geometry. Extend the `pattern_cycles` list to include the new pattern both in isolation and alternating with the canonical pattern. Also add a six-blocker template to `blockers_templates`, coupling six intervals to obstruct more color reuse without raising the clique number. These changes aim to force FirstFit to create more colors while keeping ω unchanged.
