diverse_initial_copy
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Increase branching factor in the first expansion by using five translated copies on the initial iteration, then revert to four copies thereafter. This ‘diversifies’ early structure, creating more interleavings that FirstFit must manage without increasing the clique number, boosting the FF/OPT ratio.
