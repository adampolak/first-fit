allow_two_extra_copies</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Extend the “extra_copies” option to allow two extra translated copies on the first level. This increases the geometry variants from 5 copies total (4+1) to 6 copies (4+2), potentially creating more overlap patterns that force FirstFit to use additional colors without raising ω significantly.
