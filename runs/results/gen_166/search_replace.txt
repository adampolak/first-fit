<NAME>increase_depth_for_pattern</NAME>
<DESCRIPTION>
Extend the recursive pattern search to include depth=5. The classical four-copy plus blockers pattern at depth 5 pushes FirstFit to ≈29 colors while ω=6, yielding a much higher ratio (~4.83). Including depth=5 in the search allows the algorithm to discover and return this stronger instance.
