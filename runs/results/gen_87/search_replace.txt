add_halfstep_offsets_and_extra_blocker_template
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
I propose a targeted improvement: expand the compact search space to include half-step staggered offsets and a denser blocker template. These small, focused changes encourage more cross-copy interference (raising FirstFit) without increasing the clique size much, and they are cheap to evaluate.

Concretely:
- Add start_sets entries including (1.5, 5.5, 9.5, 13.5) and a slightly skewed (2,6,9,14) to test more stagger patterns.
- Add a blocker template with 6 couplers (two extra caps) to more aggressively occupy low-numbered colors and couple copies across layers. This template expands the search without altering the recursive machinery.
- Keep schedules, translations and extras unchanged.

This edit is small and deterministic, keeps the program runnable, and increases the chance of discovering a stronger adversarial instance for FirstFit by including well-known heuristics (half-step offsets and extra blockers) from the literature and the suggestions you provided.
