alternate_offsets_blockers
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Introduce alternating offset patterns and blocker templates to break the regular symmetry of the recursive copies, which tends to force FirstFit into less optimal packing. We define two different blocker templates (one shifted by 0.5) and alternate between them each iteration. We also alternate copy offsets between (2,6,10,14) and (1,5,9,13) each level, and retain the extra far copy on the first iteration to diversify the branching structure further. This irregularity should increase the FirstFit color count without raising the clique number.
