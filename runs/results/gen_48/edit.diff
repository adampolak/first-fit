 def construct_intervals(iterations=4):
   """
   Construct a sequence of intervals of real line,
   in the order in which they are presented to FirstFit,
   so that it maximizes the number of colors used by FirstFit
   divided by the maximum number of intervals that cover a single point
 
   The implementation uses the construction from
   Figure 4 in https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00192 and increases
   the number of recursive expansions to produce a stronger adversary.
 
   Arguments:
     iterations: number of recursive expansion steps (default 4)
 
   Returns:
     intervals: list of tuples, each tuple (l, r) represents an open interval from l to r
