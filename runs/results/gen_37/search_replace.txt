centered_offsets_normalization
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
I propose a targeted improvement to the recursive adversary construction:

1. Introduce an endpoint normalization helper (_normalize_grid) so returned intervals use a compact integer grid. This removes huge floating coordinates that can harm stability of numeric comparisons, keeps instances compact, and often increases the validator/score by avoiding spurious large endpoints.

2. Add an alternative center-anchored translation mode for copies (in addition to left-anchored). Centering makes the copies overlap/blocker geometry vary in a way that can produce worse FirstFit behavior for the same clique number. We try both 'left' and 'center' translations and small alternative offset patterns to diversify candidates.

3. Return the best normalized candidate found across the enumeration (instead of raw unnormalized T). This keeps downstream evaluation consistent with other code paths in this repository.

The changes are small and localized to the EVOLVE block implementing construct_intervals: they keep the original algorithmic spirit but diversify placement and normalize coordinates for a cleaner, often better witness.
