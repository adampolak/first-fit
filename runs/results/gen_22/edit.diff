 def construct_intervals(iterations=4):
   """
   Construct a sequence of open intervals (l, r) presented in order to FirstFit.
   The construction is a recursive expansion inspired by Figure 4 of
   https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00192. Increasing 'iterations' strengthens the
   adversary and typically increases the FirstFit/OPT ratio.
 
-  Arguments:
-    iterations: number of recursive expansion steps (default 4)
-
-  Returns:
-    intervals: list of tuples (l, r) with integer endpoints (open intervals)
+  Improvements in this variant:
+  - Use a slightly richer base gadget (two disjoint unit intervals).
+  - Alternate the four-copy starting offsets between two staggerings across
+    iterations to break alignment regularity.
+  - Alternate two blocker/connector templates (one shifted by 0.5 units
+    relative to the other) across iterations to couple colors in a less
+    regular way, making FirstFit more likely to open extra colors.
