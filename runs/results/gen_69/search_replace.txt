expand_pattern_and_schedules_and_depths</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
To increase the adversarial pressure on FirstFit and potentially raise the FF/ω ratio above 2.60, we:
- Add a full three-pattern cycle (canonical, alt_a, alt_b) to the pattern space so offsets can rotate through all three over levels.
- Introduce a 'before' scheduling mode so blockers can arrive prior to copies (in addition to 'after' and 'split').
- Explore an extra deeper recursion level (iterations+1) alongside the existing depths (iterations-1 and iterations) to test if greater depth yields improved ratios.
These changes broaden the search space in targeted ways that may uncover constructions with higher competitive ratio.
