add_dense_blocker_template_H
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Introduce a new, denser blocker template H into the parameter sweep. This template uses five overlapping blockers (including one spanning a mid-range coupling) to further couple the four copies and potentially force more FirstFit colors without increasing the clique size. It augments the existing list of blocker_templates in the sweep.
