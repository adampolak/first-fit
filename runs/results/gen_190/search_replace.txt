<NAME>memoize-evaluate-patterns</NAME>
<DESCRIPTION>Introduce a simple memoization cache for pattern evaluations to avoid recomputing FF/omega on identical interval sets across different mutation explorations. This leverages the observation that many variant constructions yield identical or isomorphic interval configurations after normalization, and caching can substantially cut redundant computation, improving the overall search effectiveness without altering correctness. The change is carefully designed to be deterministic and lightweight: a global cache keyed by the raw intervals (as a tuple) is consulted before computing FF/omega, and results are stored for future reuse. No behavior changes for unique inputs; only speedups for repeated patterns.</DESCRIPTION>
