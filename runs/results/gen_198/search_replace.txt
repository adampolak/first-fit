extra_first_copy
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Add an extra fifth copy at offset 18 on the first recursion level. By introducing a 5th translated/scaled copy in iteration 0, we diversify overlap patterns and force FirstFit to use more colors without increasing the clique size, boosting the competitive ratio.
