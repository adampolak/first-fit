 def construct_intervals(iterations=4):

   Construct a sequence of open intervals (l, r) presented in order to FirstFit.
   The construction is a recursive expansion inspired by Figure 4 of
   https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00192. Increasing 'iterations' strengthens the
   adversary and typically increases the FirstFit/OPT ratio.

     iterations: number of recursive expansion steps (default 4)
 
   Returns:
     intervals: list of tuples (l, r) with integer endpoints (open intervals)
