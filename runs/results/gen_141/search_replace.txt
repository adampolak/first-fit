rotating_offsets_and_blockers_with_center_anchor
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
I introduce two coordinated enhancements to the recursive construction:

1) Rotating offset patterns across four canonical staggerings A/B/C/D
   - Offsets cycle deterministically through (2,6,10,14), (1,5,9,13), (3,7,11,15), (0,4,8,12) per level.
   - This aims to better couple colors across levels by varying how copies interleave.

2) Rotating blocker templates with alternating anchoring
   - Blocker templates cycle through three fixed connector schemes per level.
   - On odd levels, both copies and blockers are center-anchored; on even levels, left-anchored.
   - Center anchoring rebalances overlaps without growing the clique (heuristic to push FF to create new colors while preserving omega).

The extra_first fifth-copy injection at level 0 is retained to occupy early colors. Endpoints are normalized exactly as before, so the program remains deterministic and efficient. These changes implement the recommended strategies of rotating offsets, adding alternate blockers, and arrival-order engineering to potentially raise FirstFit while controlling the clique number.

def construct_intervals(iterations=4, extra_first=True):
  """
  Construct a sequence of intervals of real line,
  in the order in which they are presented to FirstFit,
  so that it maximizes the number of colors used by FirstFit
  divided by the maximum number of intervals that cover a single point

  This variant:
    - alternates copy offsets between two staggerings across levels
      (canonical and shifted) to increase coupling between levels;
    - optionally adds an extra fifth copy on the first iteration to
      pollute early small colors (extra_first=True);
    - normalizes endpoints to a compact integer grid before returning.

  Arguments:
    iterations: number of recursive expansion steps (default 4)
    extra_first: whether to add a fifth copy at the first iteration (default True)

  Returns:
    intervals: list of tuples, each tuple (l, r) represents an open interval from l to r
