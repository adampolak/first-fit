add_dense_offset_pattern
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Introduce an additional offsets pattern (0,4,8,12) in `offsets_options` to provide a denser, more overlapping stagger. This new pattern may increase the coupling between copies and push FirstFit to use more colors without raising the clique number, potentially improving the competitive ratio.
