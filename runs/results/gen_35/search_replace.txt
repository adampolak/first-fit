alternate_starts_and_richer_base
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Enrich the base gadget by starting from two disjoint unit intervals instead of one, increasing local overlap complexity. Also, alternate the four-copy offset patterns between iterations—using (2,6,10,14) on even depths and (1,5,9,13) on odd depths—to break symmetry and induce more FirstFit coloring conflicts, thereby improving the FF/OPT ratio.
