variant_search_and_simulate_firstfit
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
I propose to replace the deterministic single-parameter construction with a small automatic search over a few promising variants (different tile offsets, alternative blocker templates, two small seed choices, and recursion depths). For each candidate construction we simulate the FirstFit coloring (in arrival order) and compute the offline clique number (maximum depth) with a sweep-line. We then pick and return the candidate that maximizes the FirstFit/OPT ratio (with a safeguard cap on total intervals to avoid runaway blowup).

Rationale:
- Testing multiple start-offset sets and blocker templates explores the small combinatorial space recommended in the problem statement without rewriting the overall blueprint.
- Simulating FirstFit and computing clique size lets the generator pick the empirically best variant rather than relying on a single hard-coded choice.
- Capping the size avoids excessive interval counts for deeper recursion and keeps runs practical.
This change is local (only touches the EVOLVE block) and keeps the public API unchanged.

def construct_intervals():
    """
    Search over a few related variants of the 4-copy / 4-blocker construction
    and return the candidate that maximizes the empirical FirstFit / OPT ratio.

    The search varies:
      - tiling offsets (several symmetric choices)
      - blocker templates (a couple of plausible alternatives)
      - recursion depth (3,4,5)
      - small base seeds (one or two tiny seeds)

    For each candidate we:
      - construct intervals deterministically,
      - simulate FirstFit on that arrival order,
      - compute the offline clique number via sweep-line,
      - measure the ratio and pick the best candidate.

    A hard cap prevents explosion of interval counts.
