shrink_base_seed_singleton
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Reduce the base seed from two disjoint intervals to a single interval. This cuts the total number of generated intervals from 852 to 596 for iterations=4 while preserving the canonical 13/5 FirstFit/omega behavior seen in prior best instances. A smaller instance improves the combined score under size tie-breaks without sacrificing the competitive ratio, aligning with known constructions and earlier best-performing programs.
