# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: The code builds intervals via a two-iteration transform. Start with T = [(0,1)]; each iteration computes lo, hi, delta = hi - lo, then forms S by translating copies of every interval in T by delta*start - lo for starts in (2,6,10,14), followed by appending four fixed blocks scaled by delta: (delta*1, delta*5), (delta*12, delta*16), (delta*4, delta*9), (delta*8, delta*13). The new T becomes S. The function returns the final list T, representing open intervals; there’s a commented Figure-3 alternative return with a known small instance.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.33; produced 36 intervals; algorithm version 7 vs optimum 3.
- **Feedback**: The implementation faithfully follows the referenced construction (Figure 4) to generate a large, deterministic interval sequence; two iterations yield a sizeable interval family that achieves the reported score. The code is clear, self-contained, and passes validation tests, with an explicit alternative (Figure 3) available for smaller-optimum scenarios.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 0 - Patch Name initial_program - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Intervals for FirstFit**

- **Implementation**: The code builds a sequence of open intervals by starting with a single interval (0.0, 1.0) and iteratively performing k=4 expansion steps. In each step, it computes delta from current min/max endpoints, tiles four copies at fixed positions (offsets based on delta) and then adds four blocking intervals that overlap all four copies, updating the interval set each iteration; run_experiment simply returns the final interval list.

- **Performance**: Combined score: 2.60 with 596 intervals; evaluation reports alg: 13 and opt: 5.

- **Feedback**: The implementation is deterministic and aligns with the intended FirstFit color-ratio objective, and validation confirms correctness and test-pass status.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 1 - Patch Name recursive_ff_improved - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Recursive Block Gadget for FirstFit Coloring**
- **Implementation**: Builds a recursive interval gadget with a fixed depth k=5. It starts with T = [(0.0, 1.0)], and in each iteration computes lo, hi, delta = hi - lo, then creates four tiled copies of the current T at offsets based on delta and lo, followed by four blocking intervals. After k iterations, all endpoints are linearly normalized to [0, 100]. The main function run_experiment simply returns construct_intervals().
- **Performance**: The process yields 2388 intervals with a combined score of 2.67; endpoints stay within [0, 100] due to normalization, and the large interval set reflects the exponential growth 4|T|+4 per iteration.
- **Feedback**: The code explicitly notes that the program is incorrect and does not pass all validation tests. It uses a fixed k=5 and ignores any passed kwargs, which may contribute to failing validations; while the gadget aims to force FirstFit coloring with many colors, the lack of parameterization and unresolved validation criteria likely undermine correctness.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 2 - Patch Name increase_recursion_and_normalize - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block FirstFit Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Implements a recursive 4-tile + 4-blocker interval construction. It starts with a base interval, normalizes to start at 0 at each depth, tiles four copies at scaled offsets, adds four scaled blockers, and updates the current span; it caps depth via MAX_INTERVALS=2500, yielding 2388 intervals for depth k=5, with run_experiment returning the final interval list.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.67; outputs 2388 open intervals with large integer coordinates (FF=16, OPT=6).
- **Feedback**: Although the pattern mirrors the literature, the result does not meet all validation tests—FF/OPT ratio around 2.67 falls short of any asserted target near 3, and the produced coordinates can become very large, which may violate hidden constraints or interface expectations; the implementation relies on a fixed cap and specific pattern assumptions that may not generalize to all test cases.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 3 - Patch Name cap_tower_ff3_push - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Recursive interval tiling for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds a hierarchical set of open intervals by starting with (0.0,1.0) and, for a fixed depth k=5, creating four tiled copies of the current set at positions determined by the current span delta, plus four explicit blocking intervals that overlap all copies. Each iteration recomputes lo, hi, and delta from the current interval set and assigns the new set to T, finally returning the full interval list.
- **Performance**: Reports a combined score of 2.67 with 2388 intervals; the evaluation shows alg: 16 and opt: 6, and explicitly notes the program is incorrect and does not pass all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The construction is claimed to force FirstFit to use ~21 colors while keeping clique size at 6, but validation fails, indicating correctness gaps in the interval-gen approach. Lacking correctness checks or proofs, the solution remains brittle; improvements should add formal validation of color usage vs. clique size, tighten or revise the tiling/blocker scheme, and include targeted tests to ensure the intended properties hold.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 4 - Patch Name increase_recursion_depth - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Blocker intervals for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds an initial seed interval and iteratively expands it over five rounds. In each round, it computes the current span (lo, hi, delta), replicates the entire set of intervals at four scaled offsets (off = delta*cs - lo for cs in (2,6,10,14)), and appends four blocker intervals derived from blocker_ranges; the process yields a final list of 2388 intervals returned by construct_intervals via run_experiment.
- **Performance**: Produces 2388 intervals with coordinates growing to hundreds of thousands; the growth is effectively exponential across iterations (roughly 4x expansion per round, plus blockers).
- **Feedback**: The approach is claimed incorrect and fails validation tests. Likely causes include reliance on specific open-interval semantics or FirstFit behavior not preserved by the produced interval set, numerical scaling, or ordering that diverges from the validator’s expectations.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 5 - Patch Name ff_deep_recursion - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Recursive Interval Adversary via Figure 4 Expansion**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of open intervals by starting with T = [(0,1)], then in each recursive expansion step computes lo, hi, and delta = hi - lo. It replaces T with four scaled copies of T placed at offsets (2,6,10,14) relative to lo, plus four connecting long intervals (delta*1, delta*5), (delta*12, delta*16), (delta*4, delta*9), (delta*8, delta*13). This process is repeated for a configurable number of iterations (default 3), after which T is returned. The main entry is run_experiment which calls construct_intervals() with default parameters.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.50; num_intervals: 148; intervals: [...]; alg: 10; opt: 4. The evaluation reports a specific instance with 148 intervals and a 2.50 score.
- **Feedback**: The implementation stays faithful to the intended Fig. 4 adversary construction, producing a deterministic and scalable interval set that validates and passes tests. Increasing the iteration count strengthens the adversary (at the cost of more intervals), while the code remains compact and self-contained, suitable for automated evaluation.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 6 - Patch Name increase_recursive_iterations - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Recursive tiling for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Starts with a single open interval (0.0, 1.0) and iteratively expands it for k = 5 iterations. In each iteration, it computes lo, hi, and delta from the current set T, then constructs five shifted copies of T at offsets derived from starts (2, 6, 10, 14, 18). It adds five blocking intervals using delta multipliers (delta*1 to delta*5, delta*12 to delta*16, delta*4 to delta*9, delta*8 to delta*13, delta*18 to delta*22). The new set S replaces T for the next iteration. Note: comments claim 4 copies/4 blockers, but the code actually uses 5 copies and 5 blockers.
- **Performance**: The run produces 7030 intervals and reports a combined score of 2.67 (alg: 16, opt: 6). Output coordinates explode with each iteration due to repeated scaling, indicating exponential growth in interval endpoints.
- **Feedback**: The implementation deviates from its stated intent (description vs actual counts of copies/blockers), and the harness notes the program is incorrect and fails validation tests. The heavy scaling and large interval values raise concerns about numerical stability and correctness of the intended FirstFit coloring pressure.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 7 - Patch Name deepen_and_extend_ff_gadget - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolving FirstFit Adversarial Intervals**
- **Implementation**: It incrementally builds a list of open intervals T, starting from [(0,1)]. Each iteration computes lo, hi from T, sets delta = hi - lo, and replaces T with four translated/scaled copies of T placed at offsets 2,6,10,14, plus four connecting long intervals (delta*1, delta*5), (delta*12, delta*16), (delta*4, delta*9), (delta*8, delta*13). After the specified number of iterations, it returns the final interval list. run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals() with the default iterations (4).
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.60; 596 intervals generated. The evaluation reports the algorithm as correct and passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The implementation follows the Figure 4 adversarial construction by using recursive expansions and translation/scaling to maximize FF usage relative to the maximum point-coverage. Allowing more iterations strengthens the adversary but increases interval count; the code is correct and validated, though the repeated list concatenation could be optimized (e.g., using extend) for marginal performance gains.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 8 - Patch Name deepen_recursion_for_better_ratio - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Recursive FirstFit Intervals**
- **Implementation**: Starts from a single unit interval and, for each iteration, replaces the set with four translated/scaled copies plus four connector intervals using delta = hi - lo to scale and offset. After all iterations, endpoints are normalized to a compact integer grid by mapping each unique endpoint to increasing even integers while preserving order.
- **Performance**: Default run (4 iterations) yields 596 intervals with a combined score of 2.60 (alg: 13; opt: 5).
- **Feedback**: The approach is deterministic and validated by tests; interval count grows roughly as N_{k+1} = 4*N_k + 4 (leading to 596 at 4 iterations), which scales rapidly if more iterations are used. The normalization step cleanly avoids degeneracy, though an unused eps variable and potential scaling blow-up at higher iterations are minor cleanup/optimization opportunities.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 9 - Patch Name ff_interval_evolver - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Optimized Open-Interval FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: The code implements an open-interval overlap test, a conservative FirstFit coloring across color classes, and a sweep-based clique number computation. It builds complex interval patterns by recursively duplicating a base seed 4 times with translations and blockers, supports both left and center translations, normalizes coordinates to integers via scaling and gcd reduction, and exhaustively searches parameter combinations with guards and a fallback baseline.
- **Performance**: Score 2.60 with 596 intervals produced; evaluator reports alg: 13 and opt: 5.
- **Feedback**: The approach robustly handles open intervals and keeps coordinates compact through normalization, but relies on heuristic pattern exploration with guarded growth and a fallback, all of which pass validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 10 - Patch Name quadtiler_search - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block tiling optimizer**
- **Implementation**: Builds candidate interval sets by recursively tiling a small seed interval with various offset sequences (starts), blocker templates, and recursion depths, then evaluates each candidate with a FirstFit color assignment and a sweep-line clique computation. It caps the total number of intervals at 4000 to avoid explosion, and selects the best candidate by maximizing FF/OPT with tie-breakers that prefer fewer intervals and larger FF.
- **Performance**: Reported result uses 2388 intervals with a combined score of 2.67 (FF/OPT), produced by run_experiment via construct_intervals.
- **Feedback**: The approach is a heuristic, brute-force-style search over multiple parameter dims (seed, tiling offsets, blockers, depth); tests indicate correctness issues remain, likely due to the heuristic construction and potential edge-case handling in the offline-optimum estimation or in the tie-breaking logic. The large interval ranges and the 4000-interval cap suggest sensitivity to scaling and resource constraints that can affect validation.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 11 - Patch Name variant_search_and_simulate_firstfit - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolving Interval Adversary for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Starts with the single interval (0,1) and, for a number of iterations, expands T by creating scaled/transformed copies of T at delta-scale positions with per-iteration offsets (five on the first iteration, four thereafter). It then adds four connecting long intervals to link the copies, updates T, and finally returns the resulting list of open intervals (l, r). The endpoints are integers, and the process is deterministic; run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals() with the default 4 iterations.
- **Performance**: The run yields 660 intervals and reports a combined score of 2.60, reflecting a strong adversarial construction built from recursive expansions and connecting intervals.
- **Feedback**: The implementation aligns with the described Figure-4-inspired strategy and passes validation tests; the recursive expansion with extra branching on the first iteration and connecting intervals appears to produce a dense, multi-scale interval set suitable for adversarial evaluation.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 12 - Patch Name diverse_initial_copy - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: The code enumerates fixed sets of tiling offsets (start_sets) and blocker templates (A, B, C), then for k in (3,4,5) builds a candidate interval sequence by applying four copies of each start offset and the blocker intervals scaled by the current delta. It then estimates FF via a First-Fit coloring simulator and estimates OPT as the maximum overlap (clique size) of the interval set, selecting the candidate with the highest FF/OPT ratio and finally normalizing all endpoints to a compact integer grid before returning them.
- **Performance**: The run reports a best FF/OPT ratio of 16/6 ≈ 2.667, produced over 2388 intervals in the optimal candidate among 36 explored configurations.
- **Feedback**: The program is incorrect and does not pass all validation tests. It relies on a fixed, narrow search space of templates and offsets, and the normalization/output alignment may not meet test expectations; broader correctness checks and alignment with the validator’s output format are needed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 13 - Patch Name template_search_optimizer - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolving interval block patterns for FirstFit coloring**
- **Implementation**: A deterministic evolutionary search builds interval witnesses via a 4-copy + 4-blocker expansion from base seeds, with deterministic RNG, normalization (scale by 2, shift to min 0, divide by gcd), and a score based on FirstFit colors relative to clique number; a mutation-driven hillclimb tunes parameters (k, offsets, blockers, translation/anchor, extra copies) and a post-process shrinker prunes intervals while preserving score.
- **Performance**: Score 1.17 with 410 intervals (witness intervals provided as output), reflecting a balance between color count and clique size under the evolved blueprint.
- **Feedback**: The approach yields reproducible, compact witnesses by shrinking after optimization; the 1200-iteration local search plus size caps keep runtime modest, but the heuristic search may still struggle with scalability on larger blueprint spaces.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 14 - Patch Name stochastic_pattern_search - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adversarial Center-Anchored Interval Expander**
- **Implementation**: The code starts with a base interval T and repeatedly expands it by duplicating T with center-anchored offsets computed as off = delta*s - center, where delta is the current range and center is the midpoint; the first iteration uses five starts, later iterations use four, and a fixed blocker set is appended each round; the final T is then passed through normalize_intervals, which scales endpoints by 2, translates to non-negative coordinates, and divides by a gcd if possible.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.83; the process outputs 2644 intervals with endpoints spanning extremely large ranges (e.g., hundreds of thousands, millions).
- **Feedback**: The approach yields huge, seemingly unbounded interval sets and fails validation tests; floating-point arithmetic and gcd-based normalization do not effectively bound growth, and there is little deduplication or bounding strategy (note: evaluator shows alg: 11; opt: 6), indicating substantial room for normalization, bounding, and correctness improvements.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 15 - Patch Name hybrid_firstfit_adversary - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Recursive interval tilings with four-copy expansion**
- **Implementation**: Builds an initial small interval pattern and iteratively expands it by placing four scaled/translational copies of the current pattern plus four long connector intervals. It cycles through predefined start offsets and blocker templates, toggles anchoring (left vs center) each depth, then normalizes all endpoints to a compact integer grid, ensuring open intervals with positive length.
- **Performance**: Reports a combined score of 1.62 with 2388 intervals; the produced interval set is extremely large and highly structured, but the run is marked as incorrect and failing validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The approach deterministically synthesizes a complex interval family but does not satisfy validation requirements. Potential issues include reliance on fixed tiling/templates that may not guarantee correctness under the evaluator’s constraints, and aggressive expansion leading to very large interval sets that may exceed expected properties or bounds.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 16 - Patch Name rotating_starts_blockers_center_based - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Deterministic Simulated Annealing for Interval Coloring**
- **Implementation**: The code uses a fixed RNG seed for reproducibility, starts from a baseline built by a 4-copy/4-blocker pattern, and evolves the interval set via mutations (add/remove/move/resize) with a simulated-annealing acceptance rule; evaluation normalizes intervals, computes clique number with a sweep-line, assigns colors via a fast first-fit using last-endpoints, and finally post-processes by greedy shrinking to a witness-preserving subset.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 1.20; number of intervals: 13 (final set shown); algorithm configuration yielded 6 while the optimum is 5.
- **Feedback**: The deterministic seed ensures reproducible results and the baseline plus mutation strategy provides a structured search; post-processing via shrinking helps prune redundant intervals while preserving witnesses. Potential improvements include tuning mutation rates, exploring alternative baselines, or adjusting the annealing schedule to enhance convergence toward tighter optima.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 17 - Patch Name random_evolution - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Constructive Interval Witnesses**
- **Implementation**: Implements open-interval overlap, FirstFit coloring, and a sweep-line clique-number; normalizes intervals by scaling, shifting, and gcd reduction; builds patterned interval sets via translated copies and blockers, with two translation modes and optional extra copies, then greedily shrinks while preserving witness; exhaustive blueprint exploration is limited by a max-interval cap and a deterministic search that's reset upon successful removals.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 2.20 with 381 intervals, using a heuristic blueprint search plus a post-hoc shrinking pass (max_trials ~3000) to prune without weakening omega or color count.
- **Feedback**: The approach is deterministic, thorough, and validation-passing, producing compact witnesses via normalization and selective shrinking; however, it remains heuristic and combinatorially heavy, relying on deliberate caps and priors to control explosion.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 18 - Patch Name ff_interval_evolver_v2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Four-Copy Recursive Interval Graph Builder**
- **Implementation**: Builds a Figure-4 style interval graph by recursively replacing a base interval with four translated copies (offsets determined from delta, the current span) and four long connector intervals; optionally normalizes endpoints to a compact increasing-even grid via _normalize_grid, returning integer endpoints.
- **Performance**: The default run produces 596 intervals with a combined score of 2.60.
- **Feedback**: Normalization preserves order while compacting coordinates and keeps interval relationships intact; the design yields a large, deterministic graph that enforces high FirstFit color usage within a bounded clique, and validation confirms correctness. Potential tuning through iterations or normalization could adjust color outcomes or performance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 19 - Patch Name figure4_normed_crossover - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Pattern Optimizer**
- **Implementation**: Builds multi-level interval patterns by recursively translating four (or five on level 0 with extra copy) scaled copies of the previous level, plus four blockers. It tests three insertion schedules ('after', 'before', 'split') and an optional extra first copy, evaluating each candidate with a deterministic in-block FirstFit (color count) and a clique-number sweep, then selects the best by ratio of colors to omega with tie-breaks; falls back to a baseline construction if no candidate yields a valid pattern.
- **Performance**: Score 2.60; 596 intervals generated; exhaustive-ish search over k in {iterations-1, iterations}, three schedules, and two extra_first options, with deterministic evaluation and a final fallback.
- **Feedback**: The configuration-space search yields high color-to-omega ratios, indicating effective adversarial-like interval placement; the approach is deterministic and robust due to explicit tie-break rules, but results in large interval sets and relies on carefully chosen blockers and translations to maintain left-anchored scaling.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 20 - Patch Name blocker_order_search - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Recursive Gadget Expansion for FirstFit Ratio**
- **Implementation**: Normalizes endpoints to a compact integer grid (even spacing) and builds a base gadget via recursive expansion that places four copies with computed offsets plus four blockers (as delta-multipliers). FirstFit coloring is simulated online by tracking per-color active intervals; offline optimum is computed via a sweep-line over open intervals; conservative pruning (shrink_prune) removes intervals while preserving the best observed alg/opt ratio; the search iterates over depth, start sets, and blocker templates to select the best instance, then optionally normalizes the final grid.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined ratio of 2.60 (alg=13, opt=5) on 596 intervals, indicating a strong FirstFit vs offline optimum performance within the explored templates.
- **Feedback**: The approach demonstrates effective ratio amplification through recursive gadget expansion and targeted pruning; validation confirms correctness and test success, though the search space is exponential and parameter choices (depth, starts, blockers) drive results, with potential sensitivity to blocker ordering.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 21 - Patch Name adaptive_blocker_search - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Recursive Interval Gadget for FirstFit Adversary**
- **Implementation**: Builds a recursive interval set starting from a base gadget T of two disjoint unit intervals, then iteratively expands by placing four translated copies (with alternating start offsets) and four blocker intervals (selected from two templates, one offset by 0.5). After all iterations, endpoints are snapped to a compact integer grid via an order-preserving mapping, producing a normalized list of intervals.
- **Performance**: Default runs with iterations=4 yield 852 intervals and a combined score of 1.86; the run_experiment entry point returns the constructed interval set.
- **Feedback**: The implementation thoughtfully alternates start offsets and blocker templates to disrupt regular alignment and increase adversarial impact on FirstFit, while normalization preserves order and keeps the representation compact. While effective, the approach generates a large number of intervals, which could impact runtime and memory for higher iteration counts; the design remains deterministic and validation-passing.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 22 - Patch Name alternating_starts_and_blocker_templates - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Recursive Open-Interval Builder for FirstFit Adversary**
- **Implementation**: Builds a recursive open-interval pattern by starting with T = [(0.0, 1.0)], and for each iteration replaces T with four translated/scaled copies plus four long connector intervals, then re-centers by normalizing all endpoints to a compact integer grid via a float-to-integer mapping (endpoints mapped to increasing even integers). The normalization uses an unused eps and returns the transformed list of integer-endpoint intervals.
- **Performance**: Score 2.67; 2388 intervals generated; evaluation notes the program is incorrect and fails validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The approach relies on a float-based construction with a later integer grid mapping, but there are issues (e.g., unused eps, potential subtle ordering/degeneracy risks, and validation failure) that undermine correctness; improvements could focus on a robust, testable interval normalization and explicit correctness guarantees for the FirstFit/OPT behavior.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 23 - Patch Name increase_depth_k5 - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Alternating motif interval construction**
- **Implementation**: The function builds interval sets by iteratively duplicating and offsetting the current set (T) into four translated copies using chosen start patterns, then appending four connectors from selected templates; after a fixed number of iterations, it normalizes all endpoints to a compact integer grid.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.50; num_intervals: 148; alg: 10; opt: 4.
- **Feedback**: The alternating motif and connector templates diversify geometry across iterations while keeping omega in check, and the endpoint compression preserves ordering on a small integer grid; the approach effectively increases color potential but relies on predefined pattern pools and iteration count.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 24 - Patch Name cycle_pattern_offsets - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolved FirstFit Interval Builder (4-copy block)**
- **Implementation**: The code begins with a single unit interval and, for a given number of iterations, creates four scaled/translated copies of the current interval set at offsets 2, 6, 10, 14, then appends four long connector intervals that link the copies. After the iterative build, it compresses all distinct endpoints to a new coordinate system by mapping them to even integers in ascending order, finally returning the list of normalized intervals. The entry point run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals() with defaults (iterations=6) and returns the normalized intervals.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.71; produced 9,556 intervals; FirstFit colors used: 19 vs clique size 7.
- **Feedback**: The program is incorrect and does not pass all validation tests. Its heavy, recursive 4-copy + 4-connector construction yields a very large interval set and a high color bound, and the normalization step, while deterministic, results in an enormous, unwieldy coordinate range that likely triggers validation failures; further checks or pruning are required to satisfy tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 25 - Patch Name ff_interval_recursive_depth6 - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Fractal Interval Construction for FF/omega**
- **Implementation**: Constructs interval sequences by recursively composing four scaled copies per level plus four blocker blocks, with options for extra first copy, translation anchor (left/center), and layout schedule (after/before/split). Endpoints are mapped to a compact even-integer grid, and a greedy FirstFit coloring is used via per-color last_end tracking; omega is computed with a sweep that processes right endpoints before left on ties. A bounded parameter sweep searches for the best pattern by maximizing the ratio of the number of colors (ff_count) to omega, with tie-breakers on total intervals, then falls back to a canonical instance if the search fails.
- **Performance**: The run reports a combined score of 2.60 achieving 596 intervals; the generator uses an explosion guard (skip configurations where (4^depth)*8 > 4000) and returns a normalized grid of intervals, enabling stable evaluation.
- **Feedback**: The hierarchical, fractal-like pattern plus blocker coupling effectively yields high color-efficiency (cols/omega) in a bounded search, with normalization aiding comparison and reproducibility. A fallback canonical construction ensures a valid output even when the parameter space is pruned; potential improvements include richer pruning strategies or parallelizing the search to broaden exploration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 26 - Patch Name ff_spine_scheduler_v2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic 4-copy gadget interval search**
- **Implementation**: Enumerates a deterministic space of gadgets built by iterative copies and connectors (base gadget, depth k in {3,4}, multiple start/connector templates, and modes uniform/alternate). It simulates FirstFit coloring on open intervals, computes the clique number, and uses a normalization step to map endpoints to increasing even integers; a pruning pass further removes intervals while preserving or improving the ratio of colors to clique size.  
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 1.20; final output uses 13 intervals with alg (colors) = 6 and opt (clique) = 5.  
- **Feedback**: The deterministic search with diverse gadget variants and a conservative pruning step yields a compact, well-structured interval set compatible with the evaluator; tie-breakers favor shorter sequences and higher FirstFit color usage, and a fallback ensures a valid default if the search finds nothing.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 27 - Patch Name ff_adversary_search - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolving Interval Blocks to Stress FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Starts with a single open interval seed and iteratively expands it by duplicating the current interval set four times at offsets derived from the current delta and a pattern-driven start list, then appending four connector intervals from a chosen template. Pattern and blocker templates are cycled by iteration to diversify structure; the final interval list is returned (via run_experiment) after a fixed number of iterations.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.17; num_intervals: 596.
- **Feedback**: The implementation intentionally diversifies structure across iterations to provoke FirstFit into using many colors while keeping omega small, resulting in very large coordinate values and a sizable interval set; the approach is correct and passes tests, though coordinate growth is substantial and could be bounded or parameterized for tighter control.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 28 - Patch Name diversified_k_patters - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adaptive Evolving Interval Block Construction**
- **Implementation**: The code normalizes endpoints to a compact even-integer grid, then uses a greedy First-Fit color count (_ff_count) and a sweep-based omega computation (_omega_open) to evaluate interval sets. Candidate intervals are produced by a depth-based recursive pattern (_build_candidate) that combines multiple scaled copies and blockers with various schedules, translations, and optional extra copies; a bounded exhaustive search over parameters (depth, starts, blockers, schedule, translation, extras) selects the best ratio of colors to omega, with a canonical fallback and optional normalization.
- **Performance**: Reported combined score of 2.60 with 596 intervals; evaluation notes alg: 13 and opt: 5.
- **Feedback**: The implementation is correct and validated, leveraging a rich parameterized pattern-building search while bounding growth to keep runtime reasonable; normalization and open-interval omega computations enable robust objective evaluation, though the exhaustive search could be heavy without the depth guard and fallback.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 29 - Patch Name extra_last_param - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolving Block-Pattern for FirstFit vs OPT**
- **Implementation**: Builds interval patterns via a recursive 4-copy + 4-blocker scheme driven by base seeds, multiple offset templates, translations, and blocker anchors; coordinates are normalized to integers (scaled by 2 to handle halves, shifted to start at 0, and reduced by gcd). Evaluation uses FirstFit colors and the open-interval clique number (omega) with a conservative pairwise check inside color classes and a sweep-line for omega; a pruning pass removes intervals only if the FF/OPT ratio stays above a target.
- **Performance**: Score 2.60; 596 intervals generated; observed FF colors = 13 and omega = 5 (ratio 13/5).
- **Feedback**: The approach effectively explores a combinatorial pattern space and uses pruning to trim blockers while preserving performance, yielding a deterministic, high-ratio pattern. The normalization and safety guards prevent explosion, though the search remains heuristic and contingent on chosen templates and seeds.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 30 - Patch Name add_pruning_and_extra_copy_option - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: FirstFit Interval Coloring with Recursive Data Generator**
- **Implementation**: The code provides a FirstFit-style online interval coloring in _firstfit_sim by maintaining a list of intervals per color and placing each new interval in the first color whose last interval does not overlap the new one (creating a new color if none fit). It also includes a clique-number via a sweep-line, a normalization pass mapping endpoints to integers, a recursive data generator (build_recursive_towers) with offset patterns and blocker templates, and a greedy prune (shrinker_prune) that iteratively attempts removals while re-evaluating FirstFit and omega. A run_experiment entry point calls construct_intervals(), which is undefined, making the module non-executable as-is.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.0. The program is incorrect and does not pass tests.
- **Feedback**: The implementation relies on checking overlap only against the last interval in each color, which assumes that color lists remain pairwise disjoint in a way that makes the last interval test sufficient; this is not guaranteed for all arrival orders. The clique-number sweep treats open intervals in a way that can mis-count overlaps at shared endpoints, due to end-before-start vs start-before-end tie handling. The run_experiment function is broken (undefined construct_intervals), and normalization uses rounding which may introduce precision issues. The data generator and prune heuristic add complexity but do not address core correctness, and several components (e.g., open-interval semantics, error handling) remain fragile or incomplete.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 31 - Patch Name adaptive_towers_shrinker - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Four-Copy Interval Expansion**
- **Implementation**: Uses open-interval FirstFit coloring and sweep-based clique-number (omega) calculations to score interval sets. Generates candidates by recursively expanding a base seed through a four-copy, four-blocker expansion, with offsets and blockers chosen from predefined patterns. Includes a tail-pruning pass that conservatively removes intervals if the ratio colors/omega remains above target and omega stays fixed. Enumerates a grid of depths, offsets, and blocker templates, selects the best candidate by ratio (tie-breakers: smaller n, then larger color count), and optionally prunes the tail before returning. Falls back to a classic Figure-4 style generator if the search yields no candidate.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.50; num_intervals: 2316; intervals: [long pre-generated list shown in run]; alg: 15; opt: 6
- **Feedback**: The approach is incorrect and does not pass all validation tests. The method relies on crafted geometric-expansion patterns and tail-pruning in a large combinatorial search, which does not guarantee correctness or general validity of the produced interval set. Recommend adding formal correctness checks, unit tests for the scoring components (_firstfit_colors and _clique_number), and more principled guarantees for the generated intervals, plus clearer constraints to ensure test-validated properties.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 32 - Patch Name quad_copy_searcher - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Adversarial Interval Growth for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: The function construct_intervals(iterations=4) builds a sequence of open intervals starting from (0,1). In each of the iterations, it computes lo, hi, and delta, then creates four (else five in the first iteration) translated copies of the current set T, scaled by delta and anchored by -lo. It then adds four long blocker intervals (bridges) and inserts them after copies on even iterations or before copies on odd iterations, updating T to the new set S. Growth per step is 9, 40, 164, and 660 intervals total, respectively, yielding a larger adversary with recursive expansions.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 1.80; final interval count: 660 (after 4 iterations).
- **Feedback**: The approach faithfully extends the Figure-4 construction to achieve a stronger adversary, demonstrates a predictable exponential growth in interval count, and passes all validation tests, indicating correctness and stability of the implementation.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 33 - Patch Name alternating_blocker_schedule - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolving Block Construction for FirstFit Coloring**
- **Implementation**: _normalize_grid_ remaps unique endpoints to a compact, increasing even integer grid; _construct_intervals_ builds a recursive, Figure-4–style pattern with adjustable depth, offset cycles, blockers, and two scheduling modes ('after' and 'split'), optionally adding an extra first-level copy, followed by normalization. The implementation includes robust open-interval checks (overlaps), a FirstFit color simulator, a sweep-line clique estimator, and a parameter-grid search over depth, patterns, connectors, schedules, and extras to select the best ratio of colors to clique size.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.60 with 596 intervals generated (the run’s output includes a long interval list and auxiliary metrics like alg: 13, opt: 5).
- **Feedback**: The approach systematically explores diverse recursive patterns and orderings to stress FirstFit, while normalization keeps coordinates compact and comparisons stable; however, the search space is large, so runtime depends on chosen depth and pattern set, and there is a fallback canonical path to guarantee a result.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 34 - Patch Name ff_interval_crossover_search - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Recursive Interval Gadget for FirstFit Adversary**
- **Implementation**: Starts with a base pair of small open intervals, then recursively expands by replacing the current set T with four translated/scaled copies at staggered offsets (offsets computed from delta and the current min/max endpoints). Each iteration also adds four long connector intervals to link copies without increasing the clique size. After the specified iterations, all endpoints are mapped to a compact integer grid by assigning unique endpoints to increasing even integers, yielding a list of normalized open intervals (l, r) with integer endpoints.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.60 with 852 intervals generated (final interval list provided by the run).
- **Feedback**: The alternating offset pattern across iterations helps break regular structure while keeping clique size bounded; normalization to an integer grid preserves order and prevents degeneracy. Minor code note: an unused eps variable is present; the overall construction yields a large, structured interval set suitable for adversarial testing of FirstFit behavior.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 35 - Patch Name alternate_starts_and_richer_base - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolving interval sets with Figure-4 patterns**
- **Implementation**: Implements an evolutionary search over interval lists using a Fast FirstFit coloring and a clique-number measure as objective. It includes a Figure-4 pattern generator, random interval builders, mutation and single-point crossover, and a normalization step that maps endpoints to a compact integer grid and reduces by gcd. The GA initializes from Figure-4-based patterns and random sets, selects top performers, breeds, mutates, and returns a normalized best candidate. Note: the final run_experiment definition overrides earlier code and calls an undefined construct_intervals function.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.0; evaluation reports the program is incorrect and fails validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The approach is modular and includes sensible components (coloring, clique counting, adversarial seeds, GA primitives, and normalization). However, the entry point is broken (duplicate run_experiment definitions and an undefined reference), leading to invalid execution and failing tests; fixing the final function to return a valid interval set (or consolidating to a single well-defined run_experiment) is required.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 36 - Patch Name ga_adversary - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Adaptive Recursive Interval Blocks for FirstFit Ratios**
- **Implementation**: Builds multi-level interval patterns via a recursive candidate builder (copying, translation left/center, and blockers) and evaluates candidates with a FirstFit color count and a clique-number sweep; normalizes endpoints to a compact even-integer grid; includes a deterministic baseline fallback if needed.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 2.60 with 596 intervals; explores a modest 72 candidate configurations across k, schedule, extras, translation, and offset patterns.
- **Feedback**: The diversification of geometry (via left/center anchoring, multiple offset patterns, and blocker placement) helps FirstFit performance, while grid normalization stabilizes scoring; the approach is deterministic and validated as correct, with a fallback ensuring a result even if the search finds nothing.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 37 - Patch Name centered_offsets_normalization - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Pattern for FF Maximization**
- **Implementation**: Builds a base interval pattern via a recursive four-copy plus blockers construction, then normalizes to an integer grid. It uses FirstFit coloring and a sweep-line-based clique-number computation to constrain omega, augments with short "waves" (new intervals) that increase color usage while keeping omega bounded, and finally applies a conservative greedy prune to preserve the observed FF/omega ratio.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.60; num_intervals: 596; intervals: (extensive list shown in run output); alg: 13; opt: 5.
- **Feedback**: The approach effectively combines structured pattern generation with heuristic augmentation to push FirstFit colors up while policing omega. Its reliance on multiple seed/template configurations and deterministic pruning yields reproducible results, but performance hinges on heuristic choices (wave length, candidate selection) and lacks formal guarantees beyond empirical observations. The implementation also includes unused utilities (e.g., compute_coverage_map) that could be pruned or repurposed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 38 - Patch Name ff_wave_augment - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: FirstFit Interval Optimizer**
- **Implementation**: Implements 4-copy recursive expansion with 4 blockers per level to generate interval patterns and sweeps offsets, blocker templates, translation anchors, and depths. Each candidate is evaluated via an internal FirstFit coloring and a clique-number sweep, with endpoints normalized to a compact integer grid at the end.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.60 with 596 intervals in the generated pattern.
- **Feedback**: The scoring strategy (colors/omega) with a small size penalty aids tie-breaking and limits growth; open-interval handling via event ordering ensures correct clique computation, and grid normalization yields compact representations; a size-cap pruning plus a fallback baseline maintain tractable search and deterministic results.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 39 - Patch Name four_copy_search_boosters - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Pattern Builder**
- **Implementation**: Builds diversified interval witnesses by normalizing real intervals to a compact integer grid (scaling by 2, shifting, and gcd shrinking). It uses open-interval clique number (sweep-line, endings processed before beginnings) and first-fit coloring (tracking last_end per color). A pattern-expansion engine creates copies of a base seed with computed deltas, adds blockers anchored left or center, and iterates over multiple configuration combos (start patterns, blockers, translations, extra copies) to select the best witness based on colors/omega with a small size penalty. It then greedily shrinks the raw witness while preserving omega and colors and re-normalizes the result.
- **Performance**: The search reports a combined score to maximize of 0.0 and is stated to be incorrect and not passing all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The approach relies on a large, heuristic configuration space with multiple nested transformations and a fragile evaluation metric (colors/omega with a minor size penalty). While it attempts diversification and pruning (shrink_intervals), validation failures suggest the scoring, witness construction, or normalization may not reliably produce correct or valid instances across test cases, and the solver may overfit to synthetic patterns rather than robustly solving the target problem.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 40 - Patch Name div4copy_opt - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Four-Copy Blocker Evolve for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds intervals by iteratively applying four scaled copies plus four blocker intervals per iteration; uses deterministic helpers (exact FirstFit via per-color last_end, omega via sweep) and a greedy shrink_witness pass (forward/backward, max_passes=2) to prune while preserving both FF colors and omega.
- **Performance**: Returns 13 intervals with a combined score of 1.20; algorithm, 6; optimum, 5; passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The approach robustly preserves the witness (FF colors and omega) while reducing interval count; the four-copy plus blocker construction plus limited pruning yields a compact, evaluable witness, though the pruning is bounded by a small number of passes.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 41 - Patch Name greedy_shrinker_offsets_revert - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Open Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: Builds a base gadget T of two disjoint open intervals (0,1) and (3,4). Repeatedly (iterations times) replaces T with four translated/scaled copies plus four long connector intervals, using a delta derived from the current T and a staggered set of start offsets. After finishing, endpoints are normalized to a compact integer grid by mapping unique endpoints to increasing even integers, producing a list of integer-endpoint open intervals. The run_experiment function simply returns construct_intervals() and ignores kwargs; a minor docstring inconsistency and unused variables (eps) exist.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.67; 3924 intervals generated (list shown in the run); the evaluator flag indicates the program is incorrect and fails validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The solution appears to produce a very large, highly structured interval set intended to challenge FirstFit/OPT analyses, but it's marked as not passing tests. Potential issues include mismatch between documented defaults and actual behavior (iterations default), brittleness of floating-to-integer normalization, and lack of validation checks (e.g., ensuring l < r and robust, deterministic outputs). Improvements include aligning docstrings with defaults, adding input/output validation, removing unused code, and possibly reducing output size or making the construction conform to expected test constraints.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 42 - Patch Name increase_default_iterations - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Adversarial Interval Constructor for FirstFit Ratio**
- **Implementation**: Builds multi-level interval patterns using four scaled copies per level plus blockers, with arrival order variants (after/before/split) and an optional extra copy at the first iteration. It evaluates candidates via FirstFit and omega, prunes safely with shrink_prune, and normalizes endpoints to a compact integer grid. A fallback baseline construction is used if the search fails.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 1.50; num_intervals: 6; intervals: [(18, 20), (14, 22), (8, 12), (10, 16), (0, 4), (2, 6)]; alg: 3; opt: 2
- **Feedback**: The approach uses a targeted search over a small set of configurations (varying depth, schedule, and an optional extra copy) and conservative pruning to reduce interval count without weakening the witness. Normalization ensures deterministic output, and the implementation is validated as correct by passing tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 43 - Patch Name prune_and_normalize_recursive_template - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Optimizer**
- **Implementation**: Implements a deterministic, block-pattern search that builds interval sets by iterating copies and blockers across multiple parameterizations, then normalizes to a canonical form and evaluates quality using clique number and FirstFit coloring; it also greedily shrinks intervals while preserving omega and color count. Key helpers include normalize_intervals, clique_number (sweep-line with right-endpoint ties), firstfit_colors, and a pattern-builder (build_pattern, make_copies, add_blockers).
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.00; 238 normalized intervals produced in the best solution.
- **Feedback**: The approach uses a compact, deterministic blueprint (4-copy/4-blocker style) with normalization and pruning to balance compactness and pattern richness; shrinking preserves structural properties (omega and color count) to avoid degrading quality.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 44 - Patch Name ff_recursive_booster - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: The core function construct_intervals starts with T = [(0, 1)], then iterates four rounds. In each round it computes lo, hi from T and delta = hi - lo, builds a new set S by scaling and translating every interval in T by delta and by several fixed factors (delta*start for starts in (2,6,10,14)), and then appends four additional delta-based intervals: (delta*1, delta*5), (delta*12, delta*16), (delta*4, delta*9), (delta*8, delta*13). The updated T = S is used for the next round. Finally, it returns T. run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals. Intervals are represented as tuples (l, r) and described as open intervals in the docstring.
  
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.60 with 596 intervals generated; algorithm index 13 and optimality 5; all validation tests pass.

- **Feedback**: The implementation faithfully encodes the Figure-4 construction from the referenced paper to maximize the FirstFit color/covering ratio, yielding a deterministic, reproducible interval set. While effective, the resulting interval list is large and opaque; adding inline comments or a small translator for the scaling steps would aid maintainability and explain the math behind the scaling/translation choices.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 45 - Patch Name increase_depth_to_4 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Corridor-Wave Augmented Baseline Coloring**
- **Implementation**: The baseline is built via a canonical 4-copy/4-blocker recursion (make_copies with specific offsets and blockers) and then normalized by scaling coordinates, re-centering to start at 0, and dividing by the gcd to keep integers compact. Open-interval semantics and overlaps are handled via a sweep-based clique-number utility that processes right endpoints before left endpoints; auxiliary functions compute coverage cells and color-class runs to guide augmentation.
- The corridor-waves augmentation searches for a run with baseline coverage <= omega-1 that intersects all FirstFit color classes, then adds up to two corridor waves (J1 and J2) around a tiny core, validating each candidate with add_wave to preserve the clique bound and enforce a new color, with a tightening loop to adjust overlap if needed.

- **Performance**: Combined score: 2.60 with 596 intervals; results pass the provided validation tests.

- **Feedback**: The approach is correct and passes all validation tests. The corridor-wave augmentation, together with multi-baseline scoring, effectively increases color count while preserving the clique bound, though it relies on heuristic choices (core placement, shrink steps) that can influence runtime and potential optimality.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 46 - Patch Name corridor_waves_ff - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: FirstFit Adversarial Interval Construction for Chi and Omega**
- **Implementation**: The program builds a compact integer grid via _normalize_grid, then deterministically explores a compact pattern space (pattern_cycles, blockers_templates, schedules, extras) across two depth settings to generate interval sequences T. It simulates FirstFit coloring and computes the clique number (omega) with a sweep-line, selects the best candidate by maximizing cols/omega, and finally returns a normalized interval set.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.60; num_intervals: 596; best result uses 13 colors with omega 5.
- **Feedback**: The deterministic, compact-space exploration yields a strong adversarial interval set while keeping the representation manageable (596 intervals). The exact FirstFit simulation and sweep-line omega computation ensure correct evaluation, and normalization keeps coordinates compact for downstream validation.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 47 - Patch Name ff_omega_compact_v3 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adversarial FirstFit interval builder via recursive expansion**
- **Implementation**: Starts with T = [(0,1)]. In each iteration, it computes lo and hi to derive delta, then creates four translated/scaled copies of T using dynamic offsets (2,6,10,14 for even iterations; 1,5,9,13 for odd), with an extra copy on the first iteration, and appends connecting intervals from an alternating blocker template. The new T becomes the updated interval set, and the final T is returned as a list of (l, r) open intervals.
- **Performance**: Combined score: 1.86; 660 intervals generated.
- **Feedback**: The symmetry-breaking via alternating blocker templates and parity-based offsets yields a stronger adversarial instance, but the resulting interval set is very large and spans wide coordinate ranges, which may affect readability and robustness of validation.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 48 - Patch Name alternate_offsets_blockers - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Corridor-Wave Evolve-Block Baseline**
- **Implementation**: Implements open-interval overlap checks and a sweep-based omega computation (clique number). Builds a canonical 4-copy/4-blocker baseline, normalizes coordinates, and uses a corridor-waves augmentation strategy: locate a low-coverage run that intersects all color classes (via FirstFit coloring), then add up to two waves that preserve the clique number while increasing color count; uses a heuristic core inside the run to enable dual-wave overlaps. Key utilities include coverage_cells, extract_runs, and a normalization routine that scales coordinates, recenters, and reduces by gcd.
- **Performance**: Empirically reports a combined score of 2.67 with about 2,388 intervals; the approach generates large, highly structured interval sets and relies on heuristic augmentation to beat a baseline.
- **Feedback**: The solution is incorrect and fails all validation tests. It relies on ad-hoc heuristics (corridor-waves) whose correctness guarantees are not established, and the augmentation logic can produce invalid or non-reproducible results across tests. The baseline construction and scoring logic may not align with all validation criteria, leading to incorrect or unstable outcomes despite a plausible optimization narrative.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 49 - Patch Name vary_recursion_depths - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Four-Copy Recursive Interval Gadget with Blockers**
- **Implementation**: Normalizes endpoints to a compact integer grid by mapping unique endpoints to increasing even integers, preserving order. Builds the interval sequence by recursively replacing the template T with four translated copies at offsets derived from delta and lo, then appending four long blocker intervals; this expansion is repeated for a fixed number of iterations, with an optional final normalization step to the grid.
- **Performance**: Score 2.60 with 596 intervals generated after 4 iterations (growth follows m -> 4m + 4, starting from 1).
- **Feedback**: The approach is correct and passes validation tests; endpoint normalization keeps coordinates compact and deterministically bounded, while the 4-copy-plus-blockers expansion yields rapid growth in interval count (manageable and predictable), suitable for stress-testing FirstFit behavior.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 50 - Patch Name fourcopy_blocker_optimized - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Interval Construction for FirstFit**

- **Implementation**: The code builds a k-level recursive pattern of intervals by repeatedly translating copies of the current set T (anchored left or centered) and injecting blocker templates (A–D) with multiple offset patterns. It explores a large parameter space across depths (k), schedules ('after','before','split'), extra_first, translations, various offsets, blocker templates, and caps, evaluating each candidate by a FirstFit-like color count and a clique/omega-like measure, selecting the best by ratio (colors/omega) with tie-breaks on interval count and color count. Endpoints are normalized to an even-integer grid via a coordinate-compression routine before returning; a fallback baseline construction is used if no candidate is found.

- **Performance**: The run reports a combined score of 2.71 with a candidate containing 9,556 intervals; the evaluation shows alg: 19 and opt: 7, and explicitly notes that the program is incorrect and fails validation tests.

- **Feedback**: The approach aggressively explores a very large combinatorial space, producing extremely large interval collections and potentially brittle geometry, which undermines reliability and validation success. To improve, prune the search space, bound the number of intervals, add practical time/memory limits, and ensure the objective metrics align with the validation criteria; also consider stabilizing the blocker/cap patterns or normalizations to produce verifiable, test-friendly outputs.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 51 - Patch Name blocker_caps_and_depth_enumeration - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolving Block-Pattern Intervals for FF-OPT**
- **Implementation**: Builds open-interval patterns via a recursive 4-copy + 4-blocker scheme across multiple depths and parameter combinations, then evaluates FirstFit coloring against the clique number. Intervals are normalized to integer coordinates by doubling (to handle centers), shifted to non-negative, and reduced by gcd. A conservative prune step removes blockers while preserving the observed FF/OPT ratio; a multi-criteria search selects the best candidate with tie-breaks on interval count and color count.
- **Performance**: Achieves a best score of 2.60 (FF colors 13 vs. omega 5) with 596 intervals; search includes guards to cap growth (4^k scaling) and a pruning pass to trim redundancies.
- **Feedback**: The self-similar block construction combined with targeted pruning yields strong FF/OPT ratios while keeping interval counts manageable. Normalization and deterministic tie-breaks aid reproducibility, though the combinatorial search remains computationally intensive and heavily influenced by chosen templates and offsets.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 52 - Patch Name allow_two_extra_copies - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Adversarial Intervals for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds adversarial open intervals via a four-copy + four-blocker recursion, then prunes while preserving the FirstFit-to-OPT ratio using exact clique-number and FirstFit color computations. Core helpers include firstfit_colors (greedy color count), clique_number (open-interval sweep), and shrink_witness (forward/backward pruning passes).
- **Performance**: Produces a 13-interval instance with FF colors = 6 and omega = 5, yielding a score of 1.20; the run passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The pruning strategy effectively preserves the FF/OPT ratio while reducing intervals, and the recursive construction yields reproducible, analyzable adversarial sets. Potential improvements could focus on pruning efficiency and numerical robustness for larger instances.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 53 - Patch Name cross_shrink_baseline - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Corridor Augmentor**

- **Implementation**: The code defines a self-contained interval builder with multiple geometry helpers: overlaps, First-Fit coloring (partition and color count), exact clique number via a sweep-line with open-interval handling, and coverage experiments that produce (a, b, m) cells. It builds a baseline by recursively offsetting and rotating blocker templates across levels, then attempts to append up to two open-wing intervals (corridor waves) that force a new FirstFit color while preserving the clique number. Core logic selects an augmentable run with sufficient coverage and internal low-coverage core, then greedily adds wings using add_wave and a two-wave strategy when allowed. The final interval set is returned (potentially augmented) in arrival order.

- **Performance**: The approach yields a fairly large construction (596 intervals) with a measured score of 1.67 under the evaluator, indicating the augmentation step contributes to the objective while preserving clique constraints.

- **Feedback**: The corridor-wave augmentation successfully increases color usage without breaking clique constraints when possible, and falls back to the baseline if augmentation isn’t feasible. The implementation is modular and data-driven (coverage cells, runs, and core selection), but relies on a fixed baseline layout and may incur heavier computations due to nested scans over intervals and color classes. Overall, it passes validation and demonstrates a coherent strategy for controlled interval expansion.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 54 - Patch Name alternating_offsets_and_corridor_waves - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adaptive Recursive Interval Pattern Optimizer**
- **Implementation**: Builds k-level recursive interval patterns by duplicating and translating an initial (0,1) template using left-anchored or center-anchored offsets, with several blocker intervals interleaved. It normalizes endpoints to a compact even-integer grid after each iteration, and provides multiple schedules ('after', 'before', 'split') and offset patterns to diversify geometry. Helper routines simulate FirstFit coloring and compute omega via a sweep, and the best candidate is chosen by maximizing the ratio of FirstFit colors to omega, with deterministic tie-breaks; a baseline fallback ensures a valid output if search fails.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 2.60 with 596 intervals in the produced candidate set.
- **Feedback**: The approach uses a deterministic, broad parameter sweep over geometry variations to improve FirstFit performance, with normalization aiding stability and scoring; center-anchored translations and varied offsets help avoid adversarial placements. A robust fallback guarantees output viability, though the exhaustive search could be computationally intensive for larger iteration depths.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 55 - Patch Name iter_norm_after_each_level - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolved interval patterns to optimize FirstFit ratio**
- **Implementation**: The code evaluates FirstFit coloring by greedily assigning each interval to the first color class that does not conflict (using an open-interval overlap test). It computes the clique number via a sweep (open intervals: process right endpoints before left at ties), normalizes coordinates through doubling and centering, and gcd-scaling, then recursively builds interval patterns by expanding a base seed with 4 translated copies and 4 blockers per level. A heuristic search over multiple blueprint configurations (offset sets, translations, blocker templates, depths, and optional extra copies) selects the best pattern by maximizing the ratio of colors used to the clique number, with small penalties for large instance size and tie-breaks favoring fewer intervals and more colors.
- **Performance**: The search reports a best score of 2.60 with 596 intervals produced, indicating a successful heuristic selection among many blueprint configurations.
- **Feedback**: The approach is robust and validation-oriented, featuring guardrails to prevent combinatorial explosion and a clear, well-documented pattern-generation pipeline. While effective for this target, it remains heuristic and may not generalize beyond the explored blueprint family; the final result hinges on the chosen blueprint space and depth limits.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 56 - Patch Name add_extra_copies_option - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolving Block Pattern for FirstFit Coloring**
- **Implementation**: Builds candidate interval sets with a recursive 4-copy + 4-blocker expansion, parameterized by offsets, translation, blocker anchors, and depth; open-interval logic, sweep-based clique number (omega) calculation, and a FirstFit coloring check drive evaluation; interval normalization (scale by 2, shift to non-negative, gcd shrink) ensures small integers; two pruning phases (strict and relaxed) preserve target omega and color ratio while reducing interval count.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 2.60 with 596 intervals, using a broad parameter sweep plus two-phase pruning to refine the candidate set.
- **Feedback**: The approach effectively explores diverse blueprint configurations and conservatively reduces interval count without sacrificing key metrics (omega and color ratio); strong normalization and sieve-based evaluation underpin correctness, though the search space is large and could benefit from tighter pruning or heuristic guidance to further reduce runtime.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 57 - Patch Name ff_spine_search_prune - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Recursive block-pattern interval graph construction with FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Core utilities include an open-interval overlap tester, a FirstFit colorer, a clique-number sweep (processing right endpoints first), and a grid-normalizer for exact integer arithmetic. The solver builds recursive block-pattern interval sets, selects the best by colors/omega, augments with short waves under omega bound, and applies conservative pruning before returning the final integer grid.
- **Performance**: Performance: Achieves a combined score of 2.60 using 596 intervals (reported in evaluation), with deterministic construction and broad template exploration.
- **Feedback**: Evaluation confirms correctness and validation tests pass; the approach effectively combines recursive pattern generation, controlled augmentation, and pruning to raise FirstFit colors while bounding clique size, producing a large but compact instance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 58 - Patch Name extra_first_every_level - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Pattern Builder**
- **Implementation**: Implements a recursive pattern builder that creates p-ary translated copies with optional connectors, accumulating intervals across recursive depth and then normalizes endpoints to an even grid (normalize_to_grid). It evaluates candidates using a sweep-line to compute the clique number ω and a FirstFit greedy color count, choosing the best pattern by maximizing the ratio colors/ω across p∈{3,4,5} and depths 3–5.
- **Performance**: The evaluation reports a combined score of 1.00 with 40 intervals; the selected configuration corresponds to alg: 4 and opt: 4.
- **Feedback**: The approach effectively explores p-ary pattern variations and connector templates within a size bound to optimize color/ω trade-offs; grid normalization helps compare candidates consistently and confirms correctness against validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 59 - Patch Name multi_branch_search - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: FirstFit adversarial interval construction**
- **Implementation**: Builds a baseline adversary using a 4-copy/4-blocker recursive pattern starting from T = [(0.0, 1.0)]. In each iteration, it computes lo, hi, and delta, then forms S by placing four scaled copies of T at offsets corresponding to (2,6,10,14) and adding four fixed intervals (delta*1 to delta*5, delta*12 to delta*16, delta*4 to delta*9, delta*8 to delta*13). After completing the iterations, endpoints are normalized by mapping all endpoints to a compact set of integers while preserving overlap relations, returning the integer interval list T_norm. The run_experiment function simply returns construct_intervals().
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.60; number of intervals: 596.
- **Feedback**: The implementation faithfully implements the Figure-4 adversary pattern and uses an order-preserving normalization to keep interval overlap structure intact while producing compact integer coordinates. It passes validation tests and yields a deterministic, high-coverage instance (596 intervals) for the default 4 iterations; exposing iterations as a parameter could aid exploration of trade-offs, and the hard-coded offsets are central to the construction.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 60 - Patch Name normalize_and_parameterize - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolving Block Pattern for FirstFit Coloring**
- **Implementation**: Generates a fractal-like interval pattern with build_recursive_pattern and maps endpoints to a compact integer grid via normalize_to_grid. It then evaluates multiple seed-template configurations (depths, offsets, blockers, extra copy option), augments with short waves that increase FirstFit colors while preserving omega, and prunes to preserve the observed ratio. FirstFit coloring is optimized by keeping per-color intervals sorted by left endpoints and testing only predecessor/successor for conflicts; clique numbers are cached to avoid recomputation.
- **Performance**: It reports a combined score of 2.60 with 596 intervals, indicating an effective FF/ω balance under the evolved pattern.
- **Feedback**: The approach combines recursive pattern generation, grid normalization, wave-based augmentation, and pruning to push FirstFit colors while controlling omega, with caching to improve performance and determinism. As a heuristic, results depend on parameter choices (depths, offsets, blockers, wave_length) and seed selection, and the process can be computationally intensive.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 61 - Patch Name fast_firstfit_colors - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolutionary Block Interval Coloring**
- **Implementation**: Core utilities include overlaps, first-fit coloring, and a sweep-line clique-number. prune_strict_floats iteratively removes the longest interval if the reduced set preserves target colors and clique number; construct_intervals expands the interval set with expand_once, derives per-level targets, pruning strictly, then normalizes coordinates via mapping endpoints to even integers, shifting to start at zero, and dividing by gcd; expansion uses four scaled copies plus four fixed blockers per round.
- **Performance**: Combined score: 2.60; 596 intervals generated; alg: 13; opt: 5.
- **Feedback**: The implementation is correct and passes validation tests. The approach effectively couples per-level pruning with normalization to produce a large, compressed interval set that meets the target performance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 62 - Patch Name pruned_recursive_construction - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Pattern Optimizer**
- **Implementation**: Normalizes endpoints to an integer grid, then explores a compact, deterministic pattern space (pattern cycles, blocker templates, schedules, extras) to generate interval sets; evaluates each candidate with exact FirstFit coloring and clique-number computations, selecting the best by cols/omega ratio, followed by a deterministic wave-augmentation in gaps that increases colors without increasing omega; returns a normalized set of intervals. 
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.0; the program is marked incorrect and does not pass all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The approach relies on a handcrafted, finite pattern-space search with greedy coloring and a post-hoc wave augmentation, which appears brittle and yields correctness failures in validation; stability and alignment with evaluation criteria are concerns, and the normalization/augmentation steps likely contribute to inconsistent or invalid outputs.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 63 - Patch Name add_wave_augmentation - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Open Interval Pattern Designer**
- **Implementation**: Implements a 4-copy recursive pattern expansion with per-level blockers, sweeping a large parameter space (offsets, blockers, translations, anchors, depth, schedule, interleave, reverse) and evaluating each candidate via an internal FirstFit coloring and a clique-number sweep. Endpoints are normalized to a compact integer grid before returning.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 2.60 with 596 intervals in the produced set.
- **Feedback**: The design space is aggressively explored to optimize the scoring objective, with tie-breaking favoring fewer intervals and more colors; runtime is managed with a size-pruning safeguard, and a fallback baseline ensures a sane result if the sweep fails.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 64 - Patch Name zip_interleave_and_caps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Pattern Synthesizer**
- **Implementation**: Builds interval patterns via recursive 4-copy + 4-blocker expansions, over multiple translations/anchors, seeds, and depths; evaluates each pattern with FirstFit coloring and clique-number (open-interval) using a sweep-line; normalizes coordinates to integers, caches evaluations, and prunes results using a target ratio. The search enumerates many parameter combinations with guards to curb explosion and includes a baseline fallback; a final pruning step intends to reduce blockers before output.
- **Performance**: Reported overall score is 0.0 with a note that the program is incorrect and fails validation tests; the code also contains structural issues (undefined helpers, top-level return, and brittle guards) that hinder correct execution.
- **Feedback**: The broad configuration sweep is ambitious but prone to combinatorial explosion and correctness gaps; key deficiencies include missing function definitions (e.g., shrink_prune, construct_intervals), a top-level return, and mis-specified flow (run_experiment calls a non-existent function). Fixing these would require aligning function interfaces, completing missing utilities, and ensuring a valid entry point.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 65 - Patch Name cache_and_prune_enhancements - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Intervals for FirstFit Coloring**
- **Implementation**: Uses a normalization routine _normalize_grid to map unique endpoints to an increasing even-integer grid, then builds intervals via a recursive gadget: start with T = [(0.0, 1.0)], and for a number of iterations replace T with four translated/scaled copies using alternating start patterns, plus a set of blocker intervals deltas; optionally applies endpoint normalization at the end.
- **Performance**: Score 1.44 with 766 intervals; the evaluation reports alg: 13 and opt: 9.
- **Feedback**: The approach deterministically generates a dense, challenging interval set intended to stress FirstFit coloring; normalization preserves order while compacting coordinates, yielding a large but reproducible test instance that passes validation.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 66 - Patch Name alternate_offsets_and_mid_blockers - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: FirstFit Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: Builds a fractal-like interval sequence by iteratively expanding a set T of intervals. Each level translates copies of T by delta times a chosen offset from alternating canonical/shifted patterns, optionally adds an extra copy on the first level, then appends four connecting long intervals. After all iterations, endpoints are normalized to a compact grid by mapping unique endpoints to increasing even integers, preserving order and avoiding degeneracy.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 2.60 with 660 intervals; the evaluation reports alg: 13 and opt: 5 for this run.
- **Feedback**: The alternating offset patterns plus the optional extra_first extension increase coupling across levels and pollute early color usage under FirstFit, while the final normalization yields a stable, compact representation suitable for validation tests. The approach generates a large, highly structured interval set, trading simplicity for measured control over color-usage dynamics.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 67 - Patch Name alternate_offsets_and_normalize - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Open-Interval Pattern Optimization**
- **Implementation**: Implements open-interval overlap checks and computes the clique number via a left-to-right sweep; simulates FirstFit coloring by packing intervals into the first non-conflicting color class; builds candidate interval sets using a recursive multi-copy plus blockers scheme with various translations, anchoring, scheduling, and interleaving options, then normalizes coordinates (doubling for center shifts, shifting to nonnegative, gcd shrinking). Employs two pruning passes (strict then relaxed) to remove intervals without degrading the objective, and uses a broad orchestrator to explore a large blueprint space and select the best candidate based on a score (colors/omega) with a small size penalty.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.60; num_intervals: 596; intervals include a wide spread of coordinates; reported metrics show alg: 13; opt: 5.
- **Feedback**: The implementation robustly explores a rich blueprint space and preserves objective via two-phase pruning, but the search yields a large batch of intervals and relies on guards to curb combinatorial explosion; future work could tighten search pruning earlier or streamline interval reduction to improve scalability while maintaining the score.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 68 - Patch Name interleave_and_schedule_search - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: FirstFit Color Maximization**
- **Implementation**: Builds interval sequences by a compact, deterministic pattern space (patterns, blockers, scheduling modes, and optional extra copies), simulates FirstFit coloring and clique number on the generated intervals, and optionally normalizes coordinates onto a compact integer grid. It exhaustively explores depth, pattern cycles, blocker templates, scheduling orders, and extras to maximize the ratio of colors used to the clique number, returning the best generated interval set (normalized if requested).
- **Performance**: Reported with a combined score of 2.67, using about 2388 intervals in the produced set; algorithm configuration indicates 16 candidate exploration cycles with a 6-step improvement target.
- **Feedback**: The approach is a heavy, deterministic heuristic that aims to maximize color usage relative to clique size but is brittle and does not pass all validation tests. It generates very large interval collections and relies on multiple nested pattern choices, which can be slow and error-prone; the reliance on a complex heuristic without formal guarantees or unit tests makes correctness fragile, and there is an explicit note that the program is incorrect and fails some validations.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 69 - Patch Name expand_pattern_and_schedules_and_depths - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block interval pattern optimizer**
- **Implementation**: Builds open interval patterns via a 4-copy recursive expansion with blockers, using a rich parameter sweep over translation, blocker placement, interleaving, and scheduling. It evaluates candidates with a FirstFit colorings and clique-sweep, then normalizes endpoints to a compact integer grid before returning.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 2.60 with 596 intervals in the produced set.
- **Feedback**: The exhaustive, parameterized pattern generator effectively explores a wide design space, but relies on size guards and a fallback baseline to avoid combinatorial blowup; the evaluation ties are resolved by clear tie-break rules, yielding stable results.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 70 - Patch Name add_overlapping_base_seed - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Open-Interval Pattern Optimizer**
- **Implementation**: Implements open-interval overlap checks and a First-Fit color allocator; computes the clique number with a sweep-line; builds arrival orders via a recursive, multi-copy pattern with blockers, multiple translation modes, and various scheduling options; normalizes intervals to integers, applies a pruning pass, and selects the best candidate by FF/omega ratio plus small size penalty; includes a fallback baseline and a final pruning stage.
- **Performance**: Score 2.60 with 596 intervals; the search space is large but pruned with guards and greedy pruning to keep runtime reasonable.
- **Feedback**: The approach effectively explores a rich design space of patternParameters to optimize FF/omega, aided by normalization and post-pruning; however, the combinatorial search can be heavy, and results depend on chosen parameter sweeps and priors.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 71 - Patch Name zigzag_blockers_prune - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Recursive 4-Copy Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: It uses normalization to map endpoints onto a compact even-integer grid, a sweep-line clique_number for omega calculation, and a greedy first-fit colors routine. The core is build_recursive which expands a base seed into k levels of 4-copy pattern copies with configurable offsets, translation, and interleaving, followed by multi-stage pruning (shrink_strict, prune_relaxed, final_shrinker) to preserve omega and color ratio while reducing intervals; a final normalization yields integer intervals.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 1.00, returning 32 intervals; the search explores depth 5 and includes a deterministic baseline fallback with validation.
- **Feedback**: The implementation effectively blends structured pattern expansion with rigorous, multi-phase pruning to preserve key metrics (omega and color ratio) while shrinking the footprint; grid normalization and greedy coloring provide fast, reproducible evaluation, and a fallback baseline ensures correctness even if the search space is constrained.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 73 - Patch Name ff_recursiveshrink - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: FirstFit Interval Pattern Search**
- **Implementation**: Implements open-interval FirstFit coloring with conservative overlap checks; builds candidate interval sets via recursive 4-copy + 4-blocker expansions across multiple blueprint parameters, normalizes coordinates to integers, and prunes to preserve the observed FF/OPT ratio; selects the best blueprint by a multi-criteria score and falls back to a baseline if needed.
- **Performance**: Demonstrates a high FF/omega ratio of 2.60 on a 596-interval pattern, with pruning and normalization helping keep coordinates compact.
- **Feedback**: The blueprint-space exploration is systematic and coordinate-normalization plus pruning helps control instance size; the approach is heuristic and sensitive to blueprint choices and pruning thresholds, though a safe baseline is always available.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 74 - Patch Name add_blocker_templates - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic FirstFit adversarial interval generator**
- **Implementation**: Uses a deterministic hill-climbing search over per-level offset patterns and left-anchored copies to build a recursive gadget T of open intervals; evaluates via FirstFit color count and clique number, with a deterministic witness-shrinker and final normalization to a compact even-grid.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 1.20; num_intervals: 13; alg: 6; opt: 5.
- **Feedback**: The approach is reproducible due to the fixed RNG seed and deterministic mutation/selection logic, yielding a compact 13-interval witness with a shrinking step; exploration is limited by the fixed seed set and mutation budget, so broader seeding or parameter variation could improve robustness.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 75 - Patch Name search_evolver_ff_interval_adversary - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic FirstFit Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: A deterministic, level-wise interval builder generates per-level templates (after, before, split, interleave) of left-anchored copies plus scaled blockers, selecting the best template by a score balancing FirstFit colors and omega; endpoints are normalized to an integer grid, with a sweep-line to compute omega and a FirstFit-color pass, followed by a greedy shrink that preserves both metrics before final normalization.
- **Performance**: The produced solution achieves a 1.20 objective with 13 intervals (algorithm 6, optimum 5).
- **Feedback**: The approach yields deterministic, validated results and compact witnesses due to per-level scheduling and invariant-preserving shrinking; safeguards like a MAX_INTERVALS cap and deterministic tie-breaking promote tractable, predictable behavior.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 76 - Patch Name ff_interval_evolver - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Grid Optimizer**
- **Implementation**: Implements a recursive blueprint-based interval constructor that builds a template T by layering transformed copies of itself with blockers, using three placement schedules and two translation anchors; endpoints are normalized to a compact even grid, and candidate configurations are evaluated with FirstFit and omega metrics to select the best ratio cols/omega, with a canonical fallback if the search explodes.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.60; produced 596 intervals (final coordinates are on a compact even grid after normalization).
- **Feedback**: The program is correct and passes all validation tests; the implementation uses a modest, multi-configurational search over blueprint templates and placements to achieve a strong cols/omega ratio.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 77 - Patch Name param_sweep_offsets_blockers - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Set Optimizer**
- **Implementation**: Uses a PatternGen-driven generative search to build interval sets from a small seed, optimizes over depth, offsets, blockers, and an extra flag, then augments with waves and prunes while preserving the color-to-overlap ratio; normalization and a greedy first-fit color counter plus a sweep-line clique number guide evaluation.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.25; 14 intervals produced (example: [(42, 44), (38, 46), (32, 36), (34, 40), (28, 48), (22, 26), (24, 30), (18, 50), (12, 16), (14, 20), (0, 4), (2, 6), (0, 8), (2, 10)]; alg: 5; opt: 4; program is correct and passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The approach effectively balances maximizing the interval coloring efficiency (first-fit colors) against overlap complexity (clique number) through structured generation, augmentation, and pruning; normalization ensures fair cross-parameter comparison, and validation confirms correctness, though further heuristic refinements could tighten search and reduce evaluation time.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 78 - Patch Name modular_recursive_search - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Fractal Copy-Blocker Interval Gadget**
- **Implementation**: Core routines (_normalize_grid, _compute_four_copies_and_blockers, construct_intervals) implement a fractal-like expansion: starting from the unit interval, each level places five translated copies on the first iteration (four on subsequent levels) at offsets proportional to the current span, then adds four long blockers. Endpoints are then mapped to a compact grid by _normalize_grid to preserve order with even gaps.
- **Performance**: Combined score: 2.60; 660 intervals generated; evaluation logs alg: 13 and opt: 5.
- **Feedback**: The approach uses exponential growth of intervals to stress FirstFit coloring, aided by an initial extra copy (extra_offset) to heighten early conflicts; normalization to an integer grid ensures stable, portable coordinates, but results in a large, dense interval set that may affect downstream performance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 79 - Patch Name add_extra_copy_first_iteration - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: EVOLVE-BLOCK: Evolutionary interval coloring optimization**
- **Implementation**: Combines a greedy first-fit color count with a clique-number based objective, uses a Figure-4 gadget as a structured base, applies mutation and pruning, and normalizes coordinates to a grid. Fitness is ff/om minus a small penalty for interval count; mutation adds/removes/shifts intervals, and pruning removes long intervals while preserving the target ratio.
- **Performance**: Achieves an optimal-like solution with 13 intervals: [(48,50), (44,46), (40,42), (36,38), (32,34), (28,30), (24,26), (20,22), (16,18), (12,14), (8,10), (4,6), (0,2)]; combined score 1.00; alg: 1; opt: 1; passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The approach effectively harnesses a structured base (Figure-4 gadget) with simple mutation and a ratio-based prune to converge to a compact, grid-aligned solution. The final normalization yields evenly spaced, grid-aligned intervals, and the final prune step helps ensure the reported solution remains within the target efficiency. Consider potential enhancements around the efficiency of clique computations for larger search spaces.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 80 - Patch Name stochastic_search_adversary - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Open Interval Pattern Optimizer**
- **Implementation**: Build candidate sequences by recursively expanding a base seed with 4 copies per level and blockers. A large parameter sweep across translation, blocker anchoring, interleaving, scheduling, and reverse-order toggles generates diverse interval patterns; evaluation uses a FirstFit coloring test and a clique-number sweep, with results normalized to a compact integer grid and a deterministic single-pass pruning that removes an interval only if omega and color count remain unchanged.
- **Performance**: Produces a combined score of 2.60 with 596 intervals, obtained through an expansive pattern-generation search and pruning.
- **Feedback**: The approach cleanly separates interval generation, evaluation, and normalization, and uses standard interval-coloring metrics to guide search; however, the huge search space can be computationally intensive, and the pruning is conservative and may bias toward certain patterns if evaluation metrics shift, with tie-breaking favoring smaller interval counts and more colors.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 72 - Patch Name add_blocker_and_prune - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Template-driven interval block pattern**

- **Implementation**: The code builds a compact, normalized grid of intervals and uses a lightweight, purely-Python pipeline: a grid normalizer (_normalize_grid), a simple FirstFit coloring simulator that tracks the rightmost end for each color (_firstfit_colors), and an exact open-interval clique number calculator via sweep-line (_clique_number). It then constructs interval templates recursively with _make_candidate_template, assembling multiple copies and blockers across levels. A deterministic, small search space is exhaustively explored across combinations of depth, translation mode, offset patterns, layout schedule, and an optional extra copy; the best configuration is chosen by maximizing the ratio of colors used to the clique number (with tie-breakers favoring fewer intervals, then more colors). If no candidate is found, a canonical 4-iteration pattern is used as fallback. The final interval set is normalized and returned.

- **Performance**: Combined score 2.60 with 596 intervals produced; the approach stays within a fixed, small search space and runs deterministically without external dependencies.

- **Feedback**: The method provides a correct, validated solution by combining an exact clique bound with a FirstFit-color metric over a compact, template-driven design space; while fast and robust, the exploration is intentionally constrained to a predefined pattern set, which may limit discovery of novel layouts beyond the templates.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 81 - Patch Name interval_firstfit_adversary_v2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Deterministic Interval Adversary Generator**
- **Implementation**: The program builds open-interval adversary patterns via recursive production rules that replicate a base pattern across translated offsets, insert blocker intervals, and control arrival order. It evaluates candidates with First-Fit coloring (colors needed) and clique number (omega) on normalized endpoint grids, applies a certificate-preserving prune, and deterministically searches a capped space of configurations to select the best ratio colors/omega.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.17; 16 intervals produced; configuration explored via alg=7 and opt=6; canonical baseline is guaranteed as fallback.
- **Feedback**: The approach is reproducible and bounded by a fixed candidate cap with a pruning step that preserves key invariants; it effectively balances color usage against omega, but the deterministic search space is limited (128 candidates) and could miss stronger patterns outside the explored set.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 82 - Patch Name quadstack_pipeline - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic blueprint-based interval coloring optimization**
- **Implementation**: It normalizes intervals onto a compact integer grid (endpoints mapped to even coordinates with optional gcd shrinking), then solves coloring via first-fit with per-color sorted-interval storage and binary search for fast overlap checks; omega is computed by a sweep-line, and a recursive, 4-copy-per-level blueprint builder generates candidate tilings. A deterministic parametric search over seeds, depths, offsets, blockers, and an optional extra copy selects a high-ratio pattern, followed by pruning to preserve the observed ratio.
- **Performance**: Score 2.60 with 596 intervals produced, demonstrating a complex, deterministic tiling pattern that passes all tests.
- **Feedback**: The combination of grid-normalized, integer arithmetic with a targeted blueprint search and ratio-preserving pruning yields stable, high-quality witnesses, though the approach is tightly coupled to the chosen blueprint space and could benefit from broader heuristics or limited randomization to explore more diverse patterns.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 83 - Patch Name wavefront4opt - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Recursive Wave Pattern for First-Fit Coloring**
- **Implementation**: Employs FirstFit coloring with per-color interval lists sorted by left endpoint and uses bisect_left to find insertion points, checking only predecessor/successor for conflicts. Uses a memoized sweep-based omega (clique_number) with coordinate grid normalization to compact integers; builds a recursive base pattern, then augments with short "waves" via a heuristic that inserts small intervals while preserving omega, followed by conservative pruning to preserve the observed FF/omega ratio.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.60 with 596 intervals, indicating effective color/omega balance but substantial computational overhead due to aggressive clique-number evaluations and heuristic augmentation.
- **Feedback**: The approach reliably increases FirstFit colors while controlling omega through augmentation and pruning, aided by memoization; however, the wave-search is heuristic and computationally intensive, which could limit scalability without further pruning or pruning heuristics.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 84 - Patch Name insertion_waves - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Multi-pattern Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Constructs k-level recursive interval patterns by copying and translating the current template T (left or center anchored) and appending blockers, across schedules ('after','before','split') and several offset patterns to diversify geometry; it exhaustively evaluates parameter combos to optimize FirstFit colors over omega and then normalizes the best result to an even-integer grid. Core helpers implement firstfit_colors, clique_number, and _normalize_grid, with a build_candidate function handling the recursive construction; a baseline 4-iteration reconstruction is used if no candidate is found.
- **Performance**: Combined score: 2.60; intervals generated: 596.
- **Feedback**: Diversified candidate generation (translations, schedules, and offset patterns) improves the FirstFit/omega ratio and keeps coordinates compact via normalization. The approach is deterministic and passes all validation tests; potential optimizations include pruning the search space or parallelizing candidate evaluation.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 86 - Patch Name add_dense_offset_pattern - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adaptive Recursive Interval Pattern Evolve**
- **Implementation**: Normalizes endpoints to a compact integer grid, tracks per-color last_end to greedily color intervals (FirstFit), and computes omega with a sweep that processes right endpoints before left on ties. It then builds a depth-wise recursive pattern by combining four scaled copies and blockers under multiple schedules and translations, and performs an adaptive, multi-parameter search to maximize the ratio cols/omega, returning a normalized interval list (with a canonical fallback).
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.60; 596 intervals evaluated/generated; search space is pruned to avoid explosion (cap via (4**depth)*8 > 4000) and uses tie-breaking by smaller N or larger color count.
- **Feedback**: The approach yields a correct solution that passes all validation tests, demonstrating an effective heuristic exploration across many configuration options; potential improvements could focus on more targeted pruning or alternative objective formulations.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 87 - Patch Name add_halfstep_offsets_and_extra_blocker_template - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic interval blueprint search for FirstFit/omega**
- **Implementation**: Deterministic exploration over left/center translations and multiple offset patterns with endpoints mapped to a compact even-integer grid; omega is computed via a sweep-line for open intervals, and FirstFit coloring is tracked with per-color last_end. A recursive 4-copy/4-blocker expansion builds candidate witnesses, followed by deterministic pruning to shrink the witness while preserving the ratio, and a fallback baseline if search fails.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 1.50 with 6 intervals ([(18, 20), (14, 22), (8, 12), (10, 16), (0, 4), (2, 6)]) and passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The pruning step effectively reduces witness size without sacrificing frontier quality, and the search-space cap prevents combinatorial blow-up; the approach hinges on handcrafted blueprint templates, with a safe fallback ensuring results even in constrained searches.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 88 - Patch Name ffomega_witness_refactor - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adaptive Recursive Block Construction for Open-Interval FF**
- **Implementation**: Builds candidate interval sets by recursively composing four scaled copies per level plus four blockers, with multiple scheduling options (after/before/split/interleaved) and anchors (left/center). It uses extra-copy options to boost coupling, then evaluates each candidate with omega (maximum overlap) and First-Fit color count, selecting the instance with the best cols/omega ratio. Coordinates are normalized to a compact integer grid via an endpoint compression, preserving order. Helpers _omega_open and _ff_count compute omega and First-Fit colors respectively; a deterministic search explores a curated parameter space and falls back to a canonical instance if no better candidate is found.
- **Performance**: Produces 596 intervals and achieves a combined score of 2.60 (cols/omega). The search is depth-bounded with explosion guard (4^d * 8 > 4000) to keep runtime manageable; deterministic results are produced by exhaustive evaluation across predefined parameter grids.
- **Feedback**: The approach effectively generates hard-ish Open-Interval instances by systematically mixing copies, blockers, and schedule/translation variants, then selecting for a high color count relative to omega. The normalization and sweep-based omega calculation ensure consistent measurement; a fallback canonical instance provides robustness if search fails. The design is deterministic and heavily parameter-driven, which yields reproducible results but may require tuning for different problem scales.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 89 - Patch Name extra_middle_copy - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Open Interval Witness Builder**
- **Implementation**: The program provides a flexible recursive pattern builder (build_pattern) that generates candidate interval witnesses using a base seed, multiple offsets, blockers, and knobs (translation, blocker_anchor, schedule, interleave, reverse_alt). It then normalizes endpoints, evaluates witnesses via omega and FirstFit color count, and prunes with a strict phase followed by a relaxed phase before a final shrinking pass; a conservative size guard and a canonical fallback pattern guard explosive growth, and run_experiment simply returns the resulting intervals.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.60; final witness comprises 596 intervals.
- **Feedback**: The multi-stage pruning (strict then relaxed) effectively preserves witness quality while shrinking the interval set, though the search is heavy and bounded to prevent explosion; normalization to even coordinates and a fallback canonical pattern help maintain correctness and numerical stability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 90 - Patch Name ff_adversary_crossover - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Online Open-Interval Coloring**
- **Implementation**: Builds an interval sequence through a k-level four-copy expansion with selectable copy mode (bycopy or roundrobin) and connectors (templates A/B). It performs a deterministic parameter sweep over offsets, ordering, blocker positions, and templates, evaluating each candidate with a FirstFit color count and a clique-number sweep, then normalizes endpoints to integers while preserving overlap relations.
- **Performance**: Reported combined score 1.17 with 2388 intervals (example list shown); evaluation notes indicate the program is incorrect and does not pass all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The approach relies on a heavy, deterministic search plus a normalization step; discrepancies in the search space, scoring, or property preservation likely cause validation failures, and the fallback baseline does not guarantee correctness.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 91 - Patch Name depth5_roundrobin_search - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Hybrid Interval Expansion with First-Fit Color Analysis**
- **Implementation**: The program builds candidate interval patterns by four iterative expansions of a base interval using fixed start and connector patterns (with an optional extra copy on the first expansion), then normalizes coordinates to a compact integer lattice. It evaluates each candidate with a greedy First-Fit color count and a clique-size (max overlap via a line-sweep), selecting the best config by the colors-to-overlaps ratio and returning the normalized result.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.60 with 596 intervals; the search is a small, deterministic exploration over 12 configuration variants, yielding reproducible results.
- **Feedback**: The approach is correct and passes validation tests, using simple, interpretable evaluators. However, the exploration is limited to predefined pattern configurations, which may miss better solutions outside the fixed set; normalization and tie-breaking are sensible for stable comparisons.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 92 - Patch Name hybrid_pattern_opt - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Four-Copy Blocker Interval Evolver**
- **Implementation**: Builds a base gadget T = [(0.0, 1.0)], then iteratively expands by replacing T with four translated copies plus four long blockers (with an optional extra copy on the very first iteration). Endpoints are mapped to a compact integer grid by _normalize_grid, which assigns increasing even integers to unique endpoints; the expansion uses delta = hi - lo to place copies and blockers at fixed canonical offsets (2,6,10,14, and 18 on the first iteration) and ((delta*1, delta*5), (delta*12, delta*16), (delta*4, delta*9), (delta*8, delta*13)) for blockers.
- **Performance**: The run produces 660 intervals after 4 iterations (base 1, then 9, 40, 164, 660 intervals per iteration progression), with a final normalized integer grid representation and a combined score of 2.60.
- **Feedback**: The extra_first copy on the first iteration boosts color pressure, while normalization keeps coordinates compact and stable for evaluation. The approach yields a deterministic, validation-passing result, though further exploration (more iterations or blocker rearrangement) could refine the score or interval count.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 93 - Patch Name extra_first_flag - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Open Interval Optimizer**
- **Implementation**: The code normalizes endpoints to a compact even-grid and builds interval sets via a depth-based blueprint transformer that places multiple copies, blockers, and translations under various schedules and anchors. It evaluates candidates with FirstFit/omega (via _ff_count and _omega_open), performs a modest parameter sweep over depths, starter patterns, blockers, schedules, translations, and extra options, and applies conservative pruning to preserve the best ratio before returning a normalized result.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.40; 594 intervals generated and returned (normalized) when successful.
- **Feedback**: The implementation balances exploration and safety with a multi-template search and ratio-preserving pruning, with a canonical fallback ensuring valid output; normalization and pruning choices effectively manage combinatorial explosion while preserving quality.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 97 - Patch Name four_copy_plus_prune - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Pattern Explorer**
- **Implementation**: Builds complex open-interval patterns by recursively expanding a base seed using a 4-copy plus 4-blocker scheme, with translation modes ('left' or 'center') and blocker anchoring. Utilities include an open-interval overlap test, First-Fit coloring (conservatively checking conflicts within each color class), a sweep-based clique number, and normalization (scale by 2, translate to origin, divide by gcd). A broad search across blueprint parameters is pruned by size, with a post-hoc conservative pruning step to remove redundant blockers while preserving the observed FF/OPT ratio.
- **Performance**: The final run reports a best FF/OPT ratio of 2.60 (score ~ 2.60), using 596 intervals; First-Fit required 13 colors while the clique number was 5, i.e., alg: 13, opt: 5.
- **Feedback**: The approach effectively explores a large but guarded blueprint space and uses pruning to maintain a compact yet powerful pattern family. The retry fallback ensures termination even if the search space is restricted, and the tie-breakers favor smaller patterns with richer colorings. Overall, it yields a strong FF/OPT ratio, though the generated interval set is sizable.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 98 - Patch Name add_blocker_template_d - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Recursive multi-copy interval gadget with blockers**
- **Implementation**: Builds a base gadget T = [(0.0, 1.0)] and recursively expands it by replacing T with four translated copies plus four long connecting intervals. The first iteration includes an extra copy (extra_offset=True) to heighten early conflicts; subsequent iterations use four offsets (2,6,10,14). After building, endpoints are normalized to a compact integer grid via _normalize_grid, which maps unique endpoints to increasing even integers while preserving order.
- **Performance**: With 4 iterations (default), the process yields 660 intervals; evaluation reports a combined score of 2.60 and confirms correctness and test success.
- **Feedback**: The implementation adheres to a known Figure-4 style recursive gadget, yielding high FirstFit color usage while keeping clique size controlled; normalization keeps coordinates compact but the interval set grows exponentially (660 intervals), which may impact memory/time for larger iterations or different evaluators.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 99 - Patch Name ff4blockopt_iter4 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Interval Pattern Optimization**
- **Implementation**: Builds open-interval patterns via a recursive 4-copy + 4-blocker scheme, parameterized by offsets, translation (left/center), blocker_anchor, and extra copies. It uses normalization (scale by 2, translate to nonnegative, gcd reduction), then evaluates FirstFit colors against the open-interval graph and the clique number via a sweep; a conservative prune removes blockers while preserving the Best/OPT ratio.
- **Performance**: Achieves a best reported score of 2.60 (colors/omega) with 596 intervals (example: alg 13, opt 5).
- **Feedback**: The approach effectively explores a large blueprint space and uses pruning to trim complexity while preserving the objective ratio; results show a strong FF/OPT balance, though the search is computationally intensive and highly heuristic.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 100 - Patch Name add_half_step_offsets - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Fractal Pattern Builder**
- **Implementation**: Normalizes endpoints to a compact even-grid, then constructs interval sets using a fractal-like, depth-driven pattern generator (_build_candidate) that places four copies per level plus connectors, with per-level offset cycles, optional extra copies, and multiple scheduling/anchor options. An adaptive search in construct_intervals sweeps through many parameter combinations (depth, starts, blockers, schedule, translation, blocker anchor, extras) to maximize the FirstFit/omega ratio, normalizing the result to an integer grid before returning.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.67; num_intervals: 2388; intervals: [extensive list]; alg: 16; opt: 6. Evaluation notes the program is incorrect and does not pass all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The approach relies on a broad heuristic search with a large combinatorial space, yielding very large interval instances and sometimes failing correctness checks. While the implementation details are powerful (fractal-style pattern assembly, multiple layout options, and adaptive parameter sweeping), the lack of rigorous validation and potential overgeneration lead to test failures; a more constrained or formally verified setup is needed to ensure correctness on all validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 101 - Patch Name deeper_search_interleave_cycled_offsets - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Wave-Augmented FirstFit Interval Coloring**
- **Implementation**: Core uses FirstFit coloring with each color as a sorted-by-left interval list; conflict checks touch only the predecessor and successor around the insertion point for efficiency. It includes a memoized clique_number, grid-based normalization, a recursive multi-copy pattern builder, wave-based augmentation of intervals to force more colors while caping omega, and a conservative pruning pass to preserve the observed FirstFit/omega ratio.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.60 with 596 intervals; the approach is validated against tests and outputs a deterministic interval sequence.
- **Feedback**: The design effectively leverages recursive pattern generation, bounded wave augmentation, and ratio-preserving pruning to enhance color usage without increasing the clique number; caching and deterministic sampling improve reliability, though the heuristic relies on multiple tunable parameters and could be sensitive to their values.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 102 - Patch Name clustered_waves_and_more_templates - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Adversarial Interval Optimizer**
- **Implementation**: Defines normalization, sweep-line clique_number, and a greedy First-Fit colorer; builds hierarchical patterns with a base witness and level-specific copies plus blocker templates, iterating over depths, templates, and an extra-copy option to maximize colors/omega, returning the best normalized interval set (with a deterministic fallback if nothing better is found).
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.67 with 2388 intervals (illustrative witness); search uses a depth parameter up to 16 and reports an opt value of 6.
- **Feedback**: The program is reported as incorrect and fails validation tests; the heavy heuristic search and unbounded interval growth, along with normalization and blockers handling, appear insufficient to guarantee correctness, suggesting the need for tighter invariants, bounds, and a proven construction path.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 103 - Patch Name improved_search - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Pattern for First-Fit Interval Coloring**
- **Implementation**: Implements open-interval overlap checks and a sweep-based omega computation; simulates FirstFit coloring; builds complex interval patterns using a recursive "4-copy + 4-blocker" scheme with configurable offsets, translations, and blocker anchors; normalizes coordinates via scaling to integers and gcd reduction; evaluates patterns with a score (cols/omega) minus a tiny penalty for large n; applies two-stage pruning (strict then relaxed) to reduce interval count while preserving performance metrics; orchestrates an exhaustive blueprint search with guards to avoid combinatorial explosion and falls back to a baseline pattern if needed.
- **Performance**: Produces a large candidate set (around 2.4k intervals) and reports a combined objective score (e.g., 2.67) with substantial runtime/space pressure from pattern generation and repeated normalization/evaluation; includes multiple nested loops and a heavy open-interval overlap check that scales poorly in practice.
- **Feedback**: The implementation favors an exploratory, blueprint-driven search to maximize FF coloring efficiency, but the substantial combinatorial search and floating-point pattern construction introduce fragility (e.g., numerical stability in center-based offsets, heavy resource usage, and potential divergence from validation tests). The two-phase pruning helps, but correctness is sensitive to normalization, overlap semantics, and the exact evaluation metric alignment with tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 85 - Patch Name allow_k5_single_seed - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Deterministic FirstFit Interval Adversary Builder**
- **Implementation**: The code constructs a sequence of open intervals starting from a small base gadget and repeatedly translates copies by a delta derived from the current interval range. It augments these copies with blocker intervals (multiples of the delta) and arranges their arrival order via three schedules (after, before, split). A deterministic search iterates over a modest parameter space (depths near the input, several offset templates A-D, blocker templates A-C, and an optional extra copy on level 0), evaluating candidates with an exact FirstFit color count and a clique-number measure, then pruning strictly to preserve the witness before normalizing coordinates to a compact integer grid and dividing by gcd. If no candidate is found, it falls back to a simpler, iterative construction. The implementation includes an explicit overlaps check, a sweep-line clique-number calculation (with -1 events processed before +1 at ties to handle touching intervals), and a deterministic pruning pass that attempts to remove intervals while preserving both the color count and the clique number.

- **Performance**: Score: 2.67; approximately 3408 intervals are produced in the final candidate set.

- **Feedback**: Although the approach uses an exact FirstFit simulation and a pruning step intended to keep the witness intact, the program is reported as incorrect and fails validation tests. This suggests issues in the candidate selection or pruning logic (e.g., pruning may not robustly preserve the witness in all edge cases) and/or in the parameter-space coverage, compounded by the large generated interval sets that may be brittle or time-consuming.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 94 - Patch Name param_search_prune_offsets - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Recursive Open-Interval Pattern Synthesis**
- **Implementation**: Builds a recursive, four-copy plus blocker interval pattern from base seeds, then normalizes to an integer grid for exact processing. It uses FirstFit coloring and a sweep-line clique-number to evaluate density, augments with small "wave" intervals (bounded to 60 attempts) while keeping omega bounded, and finally applies a conservative greedy prune to preserve the observed color/omega ratio.
- **Performance**: Score 2.67 with 2388 intervals; the approach relies on multiple pattern templates and heuristic augmentations, but the result is flagged as incorrect and fails validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The design hinges on heuristic pattern generation and local augmentations without formal correctness guarantees, and some utilities are unused or underutilized (e.g., compute_coverage_map). Candidate wave placement may miss viable augmentations, contributing to validation failures and suggesting tighter correctness checks or broader search strategies.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 96 - Patch Name extend_depth_and_offsets - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Deterministic blueprint-based interval pattern generator**
- **Implementation**: Implements multi-level interval pattern construction by translating a seed with offsets and blockers, with scheduling variants ('before','after','split') and normalization policies; evaluates candidates via FirstFit color count and clique number, then applies a frontier-preserving deterministic prune.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.67; num_intervals: 2388; alg: 16; opt: 6
- **Feedback**: The approach relies on a heuristic search over a fixed blueprint space and pruning; validation shows the program is incorrect and fails tests, suggesting the objective function and normalization/pruning do not guarantee correctness and may distort interval relationships.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 104 - Patch Name frontier_compiler_v2 - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Iterative Block-Copy FF Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: Starts with T = [(0, 1)], then performs 4 iterations. Each iteration computes lo, hi, and delta = hi - lo, defines four blockers as scaled intervals, creates four scaled copies of the current T (offset by delta*start and shifted by -lo), and interleaves blockers and copies based on iteration parity to form the new T. The final interval set has 596 intervals (growth follows L_{n+1} = 4*L_n + 4 with L_0 = 1).
- **Performance**: Final results show 596 intervals with a combined score of 2.00, reflecting the deterministic, scale-and-shift construction derived from the figure in the referenced paper.
- **Feedback**: The implementation faithfully mirrors the described construction, producing a structured, fractal-like interval arrangement and the expected interval count; the growth is predictable and the approach uses simple integer arithmetic, though the number of iterations and the open-interval interpretation could be made explicit or configurable for experimentation.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 106 - Patch Name interleave_blockers_by_parity - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Greedy interval construction with recursive expansion**
- **Implementation**: Builds candidate interval sets by recursively expanding a base interval list T, applying parameterized offsets and canonical blockers, then evaluating with FirstFit and clique number; uses a parameter grid (depths, start sets, extras) to find candidates meeting a target ratio, followed by a greedy prune and integer-grid normalization.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.00 with 6 intervals finalizing as [(16,20), (18,22), (6,12), (10,14), (0,8), (2,4)]; algorithm variant 2 achieves optimality (opt: 2) and passes validation.
- **Feedback**: The approach effectively explores a small but diverse candidate space and refines it with greedy pruning, yielding a valid interval set that satisfies the FirstFit/clique ratio target. The method is robust via a fallback candidate and deterministic normalization, though performance depends on the chosen parameter grid and blocker design.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 107 - Patch Name adaptive_prune - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Open Interval Adversary**
- **Implementation**: Builds a recursive adversary of open intervals with a candidate-generation function (build_candidate) over multiple configuration axes (schedule, translation, offsets, extra copies, weaving, reversal). It simulates FirstFit coloring and omega (clique number) on each candidate, then normalizes endpoints to an even integer grid while preserving order. A heuristic search across depth, schedule, and transform variants selects the candidate with the best FirstFit_colors/omega ratio, with tie-breakers favoring fewer intervals and more colors; includes a fallback baseline construction if no candidate is found.
- **Performance**: The run yields a best candidate with 596 intervals and a reported combined score of 1.80, illustrating substantial but bounded search space exploitation; the final result is normalized to an even-grid representation.
- **Feedback**: The implementation is correct and validation-passing, leveraging open-interval semantics and a modular normalization step to ensure valid interval relations. It uses a broad heuristic search across diverse configurations, which yields strong results but may be computationally intensive; a robust fallback ensures a valid output even if the search stalls.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 108 - Patch Name ff_adversary_weave_search - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Greedy order optimization for FirstFit coloring**

- **Implementation**: The code builds a Figure-4 style hierarchical geometry of open intervals and then normalizes endpoints onto a compact even-integer grid. It provides fast, exact clique-number and FirstFit color calculations, using an event-based sweep for open intervals (ensuring right endpoints are handled before left at ties). It then explores multiple greedy reordering heuristics (longest, shortest, leftmost, rightmost, and several deterministic/random seeds) to maximize the FirstFit color count relative to omega. A conservative pruning pass removes long intervals only if the color/omega ratio does not drop, preserving the best observed ratio; the final result is filtered to integer endpoints.

- **Performance**: Combined score 2.60; number of intervals 596; the approach relies on an O(n^2) FirstFit computation and multiple O(n log n) reorderings, yielding a robust but computationally heavier search for the given instance size.

- **Feedback**: The implementation effectively leverages multiple deterministic and seeded stochastic orders to improve FirstFit outcomes while guarding against deterioration via ratio-preserving pruning. Validation confirms correctness and test-passing, though the produced interval set is large; careful handling of open intervals and grid normalization contributes to stable, repeatable results.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 109 - Patch Name advanced_spine_greedy_ordering - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Corridor-Wave Augmentation for FirstFit Stress Testing**
- **Implementation**: The code implements open-interval geometry tools (overlaps, sweep-based omega calculation, coverage cells), a baseline built with a 4-copy/4-blocker recursion ( configurable schedule and translation ), and a corridor-wave augmentation that adds carefully placed waves while preserving the omega bound. It normalizes coordinates to integers, searches multiple arrival orders to maximize FirstFit colors, and iteratively augments up to a fixed number of rounds, selecting the best candidate by a color-to-omega ratio and secondary criteria.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.60; final candidate comprises 596 intervals.
- **Feedback**: The approach effectively blends a structured baseline with targeted augmentations to stress FirstFit, plus exploration over arrival orders to boost color count without increasing omega. While powerful, it relies on heuristic choices and a fixed blueprint pool; tuning parameters or adding formal guarantees could improve robustness and reproducibility.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 110 - Patch Name multiwave_order_search - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve Block Pattern Builder Optimization**
- **Implementation**: The program defines PatternParams and PatternBuilder to iteratively grow an interval set T according to depth, offsets, blockers, translation, and schedule (before/split/after). After building, intervals are normalized to integers and an Evaluator computes omega (max concurrency) and ff_count (greedy chain-like count), with a 216-parameter space search selecting the best by maximizing ratio = ff_count/omega and tie-breaking on size and column count.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.60; num_intervals: 596
- **Feedback**: The approach effectively explores a bounded combinatorial space (216 configurations) with pruning (n>2000) and normalization, yielding a dense interval set; the ratio objective biases toward compact, low-overlap patterns, though it remains heuristic and could benefit from refined metrics or expanded search strategies.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 111 - Patch Name pipeline_pattern_builder - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block FirstFit Interval Stress Test**
- **Implementation**: The code normalizes interval endpoints to a compact integer grid, then builds a multi-level recursive pattern by translating copies and injecting blockers using predefined pattern_cycles and connectors_templates. It evaluates candidates via clique_number (max open intervals at any point) and FirstFit coloring, selecting the best by maximizing the ratio colors/clique and using interval count as a tie-breaker, with a fallback canonical construction if no candidate wins.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.67; 2388 intervals generated (alg: 16, opt: 6).
- **Feedback**: The program is incorrect and does not pass all validation tests. The broad search over many pattern variants and the normalization approach introduce brittleness and potential correctness issues; a more robust verification of interval semantics and a more constrained, deterministic evaluation pathway are recommended.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 112 - Patch Name expand_search_space_offsets_blockers - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Open Interval FF Gap Maximizer**
- **Implementation**: Builds large interval sequences by recursively creating 4 copies of a base seed and 4 blockers, with configurable translations and anchors; coordinates are normalized (doubling to remove halves, shifting to start at 0, gcd shrinking) and evaluated via FirstFit colors versus the open-interval clique number omega. A bounded search over seeds, depths, offsets, blockers, translations, and anchors selects a best pattern, then a deterministic greedy reordering is applied to the candidate to further increase FirstFit color usage without changing omega.
- **Performance**: Score=1.00 with 596 intervals; final omega=5 and FirstFit colors=5 (alg: 5; opt: 5) in the produced instance.
- **Feedback**: The combination of recursive pattern construction and a post-hoc adversarial ordering effectively yields adversarial-like interval sets while preserving the crucial omega bound; the search is guarded to avoid explosion and falls back to a baseline if nothing better is found. The normalization and open-interval handling are implemented robustly, though the large-scale generated instances rely on the heuristic search space and post-processing.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 113 - Patch Name greedy_reorder_firstfit_worsen - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Candidate Explorer**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of open intervals, normalizes endpoints to a dense even grid, and evaluates candidates by computing the clique number (omega) via a sweep and the FirstFit color count. It generates candidates through an expand_once transformation (four copies plus blockers) across seeds, depths, offsets, and translations, then selects the best normalized candidate by maximizing cols/omega and returning its normalized interval list.
- **Performance**: Score reported as 0.0; the evaluator marks it as incorrect and failing validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Several implementation issues hinder correctness and efficiency: unused or ineffective variations (blockers_variants, blockers) and a dummy endpoint injection that may distort normalization; potential for degenerate intervals and fragile edge handling; heavy search space with a soft growth cap and no guarantees of correctness for the objective, which contributes to failing tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 114 - Patch Name pattern_opt - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Five-branch fractal interval construction with interleaving**
- **Implementation**: Starts with a seed interval and iteratively builds five copies per level, applying level-specific offsets and alternating reversal; copies are zip-interleaved, then scaled connectors are appended, repeating for a fixed depth, followed by normalization of endpoints to a compact integer grid.
- **Performance**: Produces 1405 intervals; evaluation reports a combined score of 1.00 with alg: 13 and opt: 13, indicating a large, highly structured interval set.
- **Feedback**: The program is labeled incorrect and fails validation tests; the intricate floating-point transforms and connector scheme likely introduce invariants violations or nondeterminism, suggesting the need for tighter numerical handling, clearer invariant checks, or alternative normalization to guarantee consistent validation outcomes.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 115 - Patch Name superbranch - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Adversarial FirstFit Interval Gadget**
- **Implementation**: Builds a recursive open-interval gadget (k=4) by combining 4 tiled copies and 4 blockers at each level, then normalizes endpoints to a compact integer grid. It then simulates an adversarial deterministic FirstFit ordering using per-color last_endEnd points, selecting the interval that would receive the largest color (with tie-breaks by longest length, then leftmost) and updating color ends accordingly.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.00; outputs 596 intervals and achieves 5 colors (alg: 5; opt: 5).
- **Feedback**: The design shows how geometry can keep omega small while forcing high FirstFit color usage; deterministic tie-breaking yields reproducible yet sensitive results, highlighting the impact of ordering rules. The approach is self-contained but parameterizable (k, blockers) for exploring other adversarial regimes.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 116 - Patch Name add_adversarial_ordering - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Recursive Pattern with Wave Augmentation for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds a base interval set by recursively duplicating and translating initial seeds using fixed offsets and blockers, then normalizes endpoints to a compact integer grid. It then augments the sequence with short candidate intervals (waves) inserted at multiple positions while keeping omega bounded, and finally prunes intervals greedily to preserve the observed FirstFit/omega ratio.
- **Performance**: Score 2.60 achieved with 596 intervals, demonstrating scalable, deterministic generation and augmentation.
- **Feedback**: The approach effectively combines pattern-based base construction with constrained augmentation and pruning, aided by memoized omega computations and grid normalization. It is heuristic and parameter-sensitive (wave length, candidate sampling, max_waves), which may limit generalization and efficiency on other instance families.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 118 - Patch Name add_more_templates - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Blueprinted Interval Evolving Pattern**
- **Implementation**: Core utilities normalize intervals to a compact integer grid (mapping unique endpoints to even coordinates and gcd-shrinking); a fast first-fit colorer maintains per-color interval lists with left-end sorting and uses predecessor/successor checks via bisect for O(k) placement. A sweep-line computes the omega (clique number); a recursive pattern builder expands four copies per level plus four blockers, with options for extra copies and alternating offset patterns. Deterministic search explores a compact blueprint space ( Seeds × Depths × Offsets × Blockers × Extra-first ), followed by optional ratio-pruning to preserve observed color/omega balance.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 2.60 with 596 intervals in the validated run; deterministic exploration yields a consistent witness without randomness.
- **Feedback**: The approach leverages grid normalization and gcd shrinking to keep the search space manageable, and uses efficient per-color testing (bisect-based placement and neighbor checks) plus a simple pruning heuristic to maintain ratio. The evaluation confirms correctness and passes tests, though further pruning or alternative data structures could tighten performance on larger blueprint spaces.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 119 - Patch Name alternate tiling offsets - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Synthesis**
- **Implementation**: The code defines open-interval utilities, grid normalization (endpoints mapped to even coordinates and gcd-shrunk), and an omega computation via sweep. It builds multi-tiling interval templates using recursive expansion with per-level offset and blocker templates, applies a deterministic adversarial reordering to maximize color usage, and prunes the result while preserving the frontier; final output is optionally normalized again by gcd.
- **Performance**: The run reports a combined score of 2.67 with 2388 intervals, but the approach is stated as incorrect and fails validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The architecture is rich and modular ( FirstFit coloring, deterministic reordering, frontier pruning), but the stage-1 blueprint selection uses a brittle tuple comparison that mixes numeric keys with raw interval lists (risk of TypeError or incorrect selection), and the broad parameter grid plus an explosion guard makes the solution brittle and potentially non-terminating or non-portable across test regimes.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 120 - Patch Name towers_caps_greedy_scheduler - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Gadget**
- **Implementation**: Builds a fractal-like interval set by starting with a base gadget and repeatedly replacing it with four translated copies plus four blockers, using canonical offsets (2,6,10,14) computed from the current delta. It then injects four short intervals inside each copy region and optionally normalizes all endpoints to a compact even-grid via _normalize_grid, which maps unique endpoints to 0,2,4,... in order.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.60 with 600 intervals generated (as shown in the output), produced by the default run_experiment configuration.
- **Feedback**: Correct and passes all validation tests. The endpoint normalization yields a reproducible, compact coordinate grid, and the four-copy expansion with blockers effectively stresses FirstFit color usage; the approach is clear and deterministic, though it relies on floating-point arithmetic prior to normalization.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 121 - Patch Name inject_wave_intervals - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Tiling (Recursive)**  
- **Implementation**: Implements recursive interval tiling with an integer-grid normalization, a FirstFit coloring simulator for online interval coloring, and a clique-number-based pruning routine; includes multiple cadence normalizations, predefined tiling sets, and blocker templates, but run_experiment calls an undefined construct_intervals function.  
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.0; tests fail due to runtime error and likely exponential growth from recursive expansion plus repeated normalization.  
- **Feedback**: The core issue is the missing construct_intervals entrypoint used by run_experiment; wiring it to a proper generator (e.g., _build_recursive with chosen parameters) is needed. The design relies on heuristics (prune_frontier_preserving) and open-interval semantics that can be computationally expensive and brittle without caching or clearer termination conditions.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 122 - Patch Name ff_adversary_modular_search - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Recursive Blocked Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Builds open intervals by a recursive pattern-expansion with multiple copies and blockers per level (4-copy expansion, 4 blockers per level) via build_pattern across varied parameters (offsets, translations, blocker anchors, scheduling, interleaving, and reverse ordering). It evaluates candidates with a FirstFit colorings solver and a clique-number sweep, normalizes endpoints to a compact integer grid, and includes a fallback baseline and a deterministic pruning pass that removes single intervals if metrics stay unchanged.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 2.60 with 596 intervals, generated from a large but size-capped search over diverse configurations.
- **Feedback**: The approach leverages a broad configuration sweep to maximize adversarial pressure on FirstFit, with pruning to shrink the final set while preserving key metrics; while effective, the search space is vast and runtime could be substantial, suggesting potential for deeper pruning or adaptive depth controls.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 117 - Patch Name add_dense_blocker_template_H - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-block interval optimization**

- **Implementation**: The code evolves a set of open intervals through a recursive blueprint-building process. It normalizes endpoints onto a compact integer grid by mapping unique endpoints to increasing even integers. The core helpers include:
  - _ff_count: a FirstFit color allocator using a dynamic end-tracking structure with a binary-search step to reuse colors when possible.
  - _omega_open: a sweep-line counter for maximum simultaneous open intervals, with tie-breaking to treat open intervals correctly on equal endpoints.
  - _build: recursively expands a template T by duplicating and translating it, with blockers scaled and anchored according to two modes ('left' or 'center') and three schedule variants ('after', 'before', 'split').
  - A modest parameter sweep across depths, starting patterns, blocker templates, schedule modes, and translations to maximize the ratio cols/om (colors over omega), with pruning if the interval set grows too large (n > 2000).
  - Final normalization via _normalize_grid to produce compact integer coordinates for output.

- **Performance**: The search yields a final interval set of 596 intervals with a combined evaluation score stated as 2.60 (best found under the heuristic). The evaluation notes show the algorithm completes with a correct result and passes validation tests.

- **Feedback**: The implementation uses a constrained, heuristic search over blueprint configurations with explicit guards to prevent combinatorial blow-up, and relies on two complementary metrics (FirstFit color count and omega) to guide the search. Normalization to a compact grid and careful open-interval handling are key robustness choices; the fallback to canonical parameters ensures determinism if no better configuration is found.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 123 - Patch Name fast_firstfit_count - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Open-Interval Pattern Search for FF**
- **Implementation**: Uses open-interval arithmetic with a sweep-based clique number (right endpoints processed before left at ties) and a greedy FirstFit color assignment. Builds candidate interval sets via a heavy, parameterized multi-copy + blocker pattern generator (supporting various schedules, interleaving, translations, and reversal), followed by normalization (scaling, centering, gcd reduction) and evaluation. Pruning is performed in two phases: a strict pass removing intervals that do not affect omega or color count, then a relaxed pass that preserves a target ratio while keeping omega under a cap.
- **Performance**: The run reports a combined score of 2.60 with 596 intervals generated, yielding a substantial yet prune-friendly candidate set (final intervals listed in output). The search space is aggressively pruned with a guard against explosion (approximate size checks) and a two-phase pruning pipeline to retain quality without ballooning the interval count.
- **Feedback**: The approach effectively balances exploration of a large, structured blueprint space with deterministic pruning to preserve the target FF/omega ratio. Open-interval handling is correct for sweep-based omega computation, and normalization ensures stable numeric comparisons. The two-phase pruning significantly reduces the set while maintaining performance guarantees on the ratio and omega; however, the search remains heuristic and may depend on the chosen blueprint space and pruning thresholds for optimum results.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 124 - Patch Name alternate_schedule_per_level - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Pattern Optimizer**
- **Implementation**: Normalization maps endpoints to a compact even grid and gcd-reduces coordinates; omega_open uses a sweep-line with right endpoints processed before left at equal coordinates, and ff_count assigns intervals to the first color whose last_end is <= l. A recursive builder tiles a base seed with offsets, delta, center anchoring, translations, blockers, and optional extra copies to generate candidates; shrink_prune greedily removes long intervals while preserving the colors/omega ratio, and construct_intervals explores a bounded parameter space with a canonical fallback and final normalization.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.50 with 6 intervals [(9,10),(7,11),(4,6),(5,8),(0,2),(1,3)], found via a deterministic, bounded depth-3/4 search and pruning; all validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: Normalization and gcd shrinking reduce grid size and speed evaluation, while the ratio-preserving pruning reduces redundancy; the approach is deterministic with a safe fallback, yielding correct results under tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 125 - Patch Name ff_interval_crossover - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Mixed-Arity Interval Optimizer**
- **Implementation**: Constructs sequences of open intervals using per-level arities (3/4/5) with predefined offset templates, cap templates, interleave orders, cap-placement schemes, translation anchors, and optional reverse_alt adversarial ordering. It builds copies, interleaves them, scales caps by delta/center, concatenates per level, and prunes the resulting frontier with a two-stage deterministic method, followed by endpoint normalization to compact integers.
- **Performance**: Best overall score is 1.00 with 59 intervals produced; the search space is bounded by a size heuristic and a deterministic fallback.
- **Feedback**: Strengths: structured exploration across mixed arities with deterministic rotations and a two-stage prune yield a compact, reproducible frontier. Limitations: the search is heuristic and can be expensive, potentially missing globally optimal configurations; heavy reliance on fixed templates may limit generalization.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 126 - Patch Name capwave_tower_search - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Recursive interval pattern builder with FirstFit augmentation**
- **Implementation**: Implements FirstFit coloring with colors represented as sorted-by-left endpoint lists; uses a sweep-line-based clique_number with memoization; builds large recursive patterns by duplicating seeds and inserting blockers, then maps endpoints onto a compact integer grid; augments with short waves (length 1) while constraining the clique number, followed by conservative pruning to preserve the observed FirstFit/omega ratio.
- **Performance**: Score 2.67 with 2388 intervals reported; evaluation notes indicate correctness issues on validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The approach combines pattern generation, greedy augmentation, and ratio-preserving pruning, but relies on brittle heuristics and multiple heuristic guards that may not be robust across tests; potential edge-case bugs and heavy computation risk contribute to the reported incorrectness.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 127 - Patch Name add_depth5 - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Open-Interval Pattern Optimizer**
- **Implementation**: Implements open-interval overlap checks and simulates FirstFit coloring; builds patterns by recursively composing 4 translated copies of a base interval set plus 4 blockers, across multiple seeds, offsets, translations, and depths, with optional extra copies and a pruning pass to remove redundant blockers while preserving the observed FF/omega ratio; coordinates are normalized to small integers for stable evaluation.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 2.60 with 596 intervals (FF colors = 13, omega = 5) on the final candidate; the search is bounded (size cap around 2000) and refined by a conservative shrink_prune step after selecting a best pattern.
- **Feedback**: Demonstrates effective pattern generation to maximize FF/omega, but the exploration is combinatorially heavy; pruning helps reduce size while preserving the ratio, though some high-potential configurations may still be missed due to deterministic heuristics.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 128 - Patch Name allow_two_extra_copies - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolving Open Intervals for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds a recursive open-interval construction starting from a single base interval. At each of k=4 levels, it tiles four scaled copies of the current set using one of two alternating offset patterns, calculated from the current global span (delta), and then appends six blocking intervals that overlap all copies; the result is the final interval set T returned by construct_intervals.
- **Performance**: The run reports a combined score of 1.31 with 766 intervals generated (and shows algorithm/config details: alg: 17, opt: 13), indicating substantial growth and testing breadth within the given depth.
- **Feedback**: The approach is deterministic and depth-bounded, using offset tiling plus blocking intervals to force FirstFit behavior; a minor documentation inconsistency notes “6 blockers” in code comments vs. the actual six blockers added, while the implementation itself is coherent and validated.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 129 - Patch Name alternate_offsets_and_extra_blockers - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolving Adversarial Interval Sequence**
- **Implementation**: Implements open-interval FirstFit coloring and an omega (clique) computation via event sweep; builds adversarial intervals by iterative expansion with fixed offsets and blockers, using per-level strict pruning to preserve color count and omega, followed by a relaxed prune and normalization to a compact integer grid.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 1.00; produces a single interval in the tested instance ([(0, 1)]) with both algorithm and optimum counts equal to 1.
- **Feedback**: The approach correctly preserves key invariants (FirstFit color count and omega) while aggressively pruning, and normalization yields stable integer coordinates; testing shows a valid, minimal result, though broader tests would better validate robustness across more complex instances.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 130 - Patch Name ff_interval_crossover - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block FirstFit/omega Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Implements internal helpers (_normalize_grid, _firstfit_colors, _clique_number) and a recursive _make_candidate_template to generate a hierarchical interval pattern. It prunes a small, fixed configuration space (depths, translations, offset sets, schedules, extras) to maximize the ratio of FirstFit colors used to the open-interval clique number, with a fallback canonical pattern if no best pattern is found.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.67; 2388 intervals generated in the final pattern.
- **Feedback**: The program is incorrect and does not pass all validation tests; its reliance on a handcrafted, fixed-template search and large produced interval sets likely leads to edge-case failures and non-generalizable results.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 131 - Patch Name deepen_canonical_and_prune_search - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: FirstFit Interval Adversary Constructor**
- **Implementation**: Builds an adversarial interval set via recursive expansion: start T = [(0.0,1.0)], at each level replace T with four staggered copies plus four connecting long intervals determined from delta, then optionally normalize endpoints with _normalize_grid to a compact grid of increasing even integers. The gcd import is unused and could be removed.
- **Performance**: Combined score: 2.60; intervals generated: 596.
- **Feedback**: The recursive construction with staggered copies and blockers effectively inflates FirstFit color usage while keeping clique size controlled; normalization yields deterministic, compact coordinates. Consider removing unused imports and parameterizing iterations/normalization for broader experimentation.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 132 - Patch Name ff_open_interval_adversary_cross - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Heuristic Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Implements a deterministic, multi-parameter search that recursively expands a small base seed into a larger interval set by applying copies, blockers, and layout rules across several parameter axes (offsets, translation, blocker anchor, order, normalization). It normalizes endpoints to a compact even grid, evaluates omega via a sweep-line, and FirstFit color count as a certificate; then two pruning stages (certificate-preserving and ratio-based shrinking) select a compact, valid final set.
- **Performance**: Combined score target 1.50; returns 5 intervals [(14,16), (10,16), (4,8), (6,12), (0,2)]; uses MAX_CANDIDATES=128 candidate configurations and a deterministic, exhaustive-like search with a fallback canonical pattern if no candidate is found.
- **Feedback**: The approach is correct and passes validation tests, producing a reproducible, certificate-consistent interval set; however, the bounded, combinatorial search may raise scalability concerns for larger depths unless additional pruning or heuristics are introduced.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 133 - Patch Name quadstack-evolve - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Rotor-based Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: Combines rotor-based tilings with blocker templates to recursively expand open intervals, then prunes while preserving the FirstFit/omega ratio, and finally maps endpoints to a compact even-integer grid. Core utilities include overlap tests, FirstFit coloring, exact open-interval omega (clique number), and deterministic pruning with a small, bounded search over depth, rotor usage, blockers, and an extra first copy.
- **Performance**: Produces a strong instance with 596 intervals and a combined score of 2.60 (as reported by the evaluator) for run_experiment.
- **Feedback**: The approach is correct and passes validation tests; deterministic pruning and structured tilings yield stable ratio preservation while keeping the instance compact on an even grid. The bounded param-grid search with a canonical fallback ensures robustness if exploration misses the best candidate.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 134 - Patch Name ff_frontier_rotor - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Interval Pattern Synthesis for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Implements _normalize_grid to map unique endpoints to increasing even integers while preserving order, and build_intervals using a deterministic, compact pattern space (pattern_cycles, blockers_templates, schedules, extras) explored across two depth settings. It simulates FirstFit coloring and clique size (omega) with exact overlap checks, selects the best interval set by maximizing the ratio of colors to omega, and returns a normalized grid (optional).
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.60; 596 intervals produced, with final candidate shown and evaluation metrics alg: 13; opt: 5.
- **Feedback**: The deterministic search over a compact space yields a strong ratio but results in a large interval set and heavy exact-check computations; opportunities exist to prune search space, incorporate more patterns or heuristics, and optimize FirstFit/omega calculations for scalability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 135 - Patch Name add_before_schedule - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolving Blocked Interval Patterns**

- **Implementation**: Generates candidate open-interval patterns via a 4-copy recursive expansion with per-level blockers, parameterized by offsets, translations, blocker templates, depth, and interleaving/scheduling; evaluates candidates with an internal FirstFit coloring and a clique-number sweep on a grid-normalized version of the intervals, followed by a greedy prune to preserve the frontier ratio. Note: the prune block includes patch-markers ('+' prefixed lines) that would break execution unless cleaned.

- **Performance**: The score is computed as colors/omega with a small size penalty, but the environment reports the combined score to maximize as 0.0, and the extensive parameter sweep coupled with growth limits makes the approach computationally heavy and prone to not passing validation.

- **Feedback**: The approach is brittle and fails validation tests, with issues including potential syntax problems from patch markers, an expansive search space, and pruning logic that may not preserve correctness under all configurations; a fallback baseline is used if no best candidate is found.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 136 - Patch Name add_pruning_pass_for_efficiency - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Adaptive Recursive Interval Pattern Optimizer**  
- **Implementation**: Builds candidate interval sets by recursively duplicating a base pattern (four copies per level) and four connectors, with configurable starts, blockers, schedule (after/before/split/interleaved), translation (left/center), and optional extra copies; endpoints are normalized to a compact integer grid, and the best pattern is chosen by maximizing the ratio of FirstFit colors to omega (with tie-breakers), falling back to a canonical pattern if the search fails, then augmenting with short waves in the largest gaps.  
- **Performance**: The search prunes depth growth to avoid explosion ((4^d)*8 <= 4000) and returns a dense 596-interval instance with a reported combined score of 2.60.  
- **Feedback**: The approach leverages a strong heuristic blend (FirstFit with omega) and post-augmentation to improve density, but relies on many tunable knobs and depth-bound heuristics, making results sensitive to parameter choices; the normalization and augmentation steps help compactness but introduce potential bias toward the chosen gap-strategy.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 137 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Recursive Block Pattern Optimizer**
- **Implementation**: Normalizes interval endpoints to a compact integer grid (distinct endpoints mapped to increasing even integers). Uses a greedy per-color last_end tracker for FirstFit counts, and a sweep-line omega for open intervals. Builds recursive, rotated pattern blocks across levels with configurable starts, blockers, schedule, translation, and an optional extra copy; sweeps a parameter space (depth, starts, blockers, schedule, translation, extras) to maximize cols/omega, with a deterministic fallback canonical instance; returns normalized intervals.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.60; 596 intervals produced; search prunes by size (4^d * 8 > 4000) to limit explosion, and falls back to canonical if nothing better is found.
- **Feedback**: The implementation is correct and passes validation tests; the recursive, rotated-pattern approach effectively explores structured interval constructions while normalization ensures compact coordinates. Trade-offs include heuristic parameter-space search and tie-breaking that influence final results, though a deterministic canonical fallback provides a safe baseline.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 138 - Patch Name rotate_offsets_and_blockers_per_level - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Recursive interval pattern optimization**
- **Implementation**: The code constructs open interval lists via a 4-copy recursive pattern with blockers, controlled by a rich parameter sweep (base seeds, depth, offsets, blocker templates, translations, blocker anchors, scheduling, interleaving, and reverse orders). It uses internal helpers for overlap checks, FirstFit coloring, open-interval clique number (with tie-breaking in event processing), and grid-normalization. A key function, build_pattern, recursively expands a base seed k times, producing candidate interval sets, which are then evaluated by a custom score (colors/omega) with a tiny penalty for larger instances; the best candidate is returned after normalization to a compact integer grid. A safety fallback rebuilds a baseline pattern if the sweep yields nothing.

- **Performance**: The run achieves a combined score of 1.40 with 852 intervals in the produced solution.

- **Feedback**: The approach effectively explores a large design space to optimize FirstFit performance on open intervals, using precise open-interval handling and tie-breaking that favors smaller solutions with higher colors. The heavy parameter sweep yields a robust result, but the search space is large and potentially time-consuming; a fallback baseline adds resilience, and normalization ensures compact output. Potential improvements include pruning symmetry, parallelizing the sweep, and early bounding to reduce exploration of redundant configurations.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 139 - Patch Name ff_lastend_optimizer - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Recursive Block-Pattern Interval Construction for First-Fit**
- **Implementation**: Uses a recursive "four copies + four blockers" pattern builder (_build_pattern) across depths with two placement modes ('left' or 'center'), then normalizes endpoints to an even-integer grid via _normalize_grid. It evaluates candidate patterns with First-Fit color counting (_ff_count) and open-interval omega (_omega_open), performing a small heuristic search over predefined templates (offset_sets, blocker_sets, translations) to maximize the ratio cols/omega, with a fallback canonical pattern if no candidate is found.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 2.60 with 596 intervals.
- **Feedback**: The approach effectively exploits pattern recursion and grid normalization to balance color usage against overlap; however, its reliance on a fixed template search space and a depth cap may limit optimality and scalability in larger or more varied inputs. The fallback mechanism helps ensure correctness when the search misses viable candidates.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 140 - Patch Name evolved_interval_constructor - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: Builds intervals by iteratively replacing the current set T with multiple translated copies plus level-specific blockers. It cycles four offset patterns (A–D) and three blocker templates per level, applies centering or left-anchoring based on level parity, optionally adds a fifth copy on the first iteration, and finally normalizes endpoints to a compact integer grid to preserve order and avoid degeneracy.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.57 with 660 intervals produced (output includes a large, deterministic interval list; alg: 11, opt: 7).
- **Feedback**: The rotation of offsets and blockers across levels yields a dense, fractal-like interval family suitable for FirstFit stress-testing; extra_first and anchoring choices influence early color distribution, while normalization keeps endpoints on a clean integer grid. The implementation is deterministic and validates against tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 141 - Patch Name rotating_offsets_and_blockers_with_center_anchor - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Heuristic Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: Builds candidate interval sets across k levels using a mix of copies and blockers, with two translation modes ('left' and 'center'), multiple offset patterns, and four scheduling strategies ('after','before','split','interleaved'). It normalizes endpoints to a compact even-integer grid, then selects the best candidate by maximizing the FirstFit color count to the omega (clique) ratio, with tie-breakers on size and color count; includes a fallback baseline construction if no candidate is found.
- **Performance**: Reported metrics show a combined score of 2.60 with 596 intervals; algorithm variant details include alg: 13 and opt: 5.
- **Feedback**: The implementation is correct and passes all validation tests; its broad, deterministic exploration of geometries and grid normalization enhance robustness and validator scoring.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 142 - Patch Name add_interleaved_and_halfstep_offsets - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Generator**

- **Implementation**: Generates interval sets by recursively composing copies of existing blocks with left-anchored and center-anchored translations, plus multiple offset patterns and scheduling orders. It normalizes endpoints to a compact even-integer grid, evaluates candidates using FirstFit color count and clique number, and selects the best by color-to-clique ratio with tie-breakers on size and color count; a deterministic "wave" augmentation adds short intervals to boost colors without increasing the clique number, with a fallback baseline construction if the search fails.

- **Performance**: Combined score 2.60 with 600 intervals; the approach searches a broad parameter space and passes the validation tests.

- **Feedback**: Diversification through multiple translations and offsets improves the FirstFit vs. omega ratio, while normalization keeps coordinates compact and validator-friendly. The deterministic wave-augmentation and a robust baseline fallback contribute to stable, predictable results under test conditions.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 143 - Patch Name add_wave_augmentation - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Recursive four-copy interval expansion with waves**
- **Implementation**: The core function starts with T = [(0.0, 1.0)] and, for a given number of iterations, replaces T by four translated copies placed at offsets derived from the current span (delta) and lo, plus four long connector intervals. After the iterations, it adds a wave of short intervals (wave_length = span/100, up to 60 waves) and finally normalizes all endpoints by mapping unique endpoints to increasing even integers starting at 0, returning the resulting list of (l, r) pairs. run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals().
- **Performance**: It reports a combined score of 2.17 with 629 intervals produced (algorithm id 13, opt 6). The interval count grows roughly as |S| = 4|T| + 4 per iteration, yielding 596 base intervals before waves for 4 iterations, plus 33 wave intervals to total 629.
- **Feedback**: The construction exhibits exponential growth in interval count with iteration depth, enabling strong adversarial patterns while keeping clique size bounded; normalization to an integer grid preserves ordering and avoids degeneracy, though the eps variable is unused and could be removed. The wave booster increases the color count without inflating the clique bound, at the cost of additional intervals (capped waves).
**Program Identifier:** Generation 145 - Patch Name add_wave_intervals - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Wave-augmented FirstFit interval coloring construction**
- **Implementation**: The program builds and optimizes open intervals using a combination of recursive pattern generation, greedy FirstFit coloring with tight conflict checks, and cache-backed computations. Intervals are normalized onto a compact integer grid; FirstFit colors are managed per color with sorted-by-left endpoints and local predecessor/successor checks; clique number is computed via sweep events with memoization; a wave-augmentation mechanism injects short intervals to raise colors while constraining omega; final pruning preserves the observed color-to-omega ratio.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.60; num_intervals: 596; validated as correct by tests (the evaluator reports correct behavior and passes validation).
- **Feedback**: The approach uses heavy memoization (caching by exact interval lists) and heuristic augmentation to push FirstFit colors up without increasing omega, followed by deterministic pruning to keep instances compact. While effective, the method can be computationally intensive due to extensive candidate generation and repeated clique/color evaluations; caching mitigates some cost but may incur memory growth for large search spaces.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 146 - Patch Name add_cache_for_ff_omega - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Recursive Interval Gadget**
- **Implementation**: Builds a recursive gadget (k levels) of open intervals via a candidate search over multiple variants (depths, translations, schedules, offsets, and an optional extra copy). For each candidate it normalizes endpoints to integers, computes clique number (maximum overlap) and FirstFit color count, then selects the candidate with the best cols/overlap ratio (tie-breaks by smaller size and more colors). A size guard prevents explosive growth, and a baseline fallback is used if no candidate is found.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.60; num_intervals: 596; intervals are explicitly listed from the best candidate.
- **Feedback**: The approach effectively explores diverse geometric variants to optimize the FirstFit/omega ratio, while enforcing runtime control via an approximate-size cap and a fallback path. It uses precise open-interval semantics and robust normalization to enable correct evaluation and comparison of candidates.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 147 - Patch Name ff_interval_crossover - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adversarial FirstFit Interval Pattern Generator**
- **Implementation**: Builds candidate interval sequences via a structured parameter sweep (depths, offset cycles, blocker templates, translation, anchors, normalization schedules) using helpers that simulate FirstFit (color counting) and compute clique numbers; patterns are generated, normalized, and pruned deterministically with shrink_prune to maximize the ratio of colors over clique size, with a final integer-grid mapping. A fallback classic 4-iteration pattern is used if no candidate improves the baseline.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 1.50; produced 6 intervals: [(16, 18), (14, 20), (8, 12), (10, 16), (0, 4), (2, 6)]; alg: 3; opt: 2.
- **Feedback**: The approach effectively explores a modular, rule-based space to maximize FirstFit color density relative to ω, and uses deterministic pruning to keep results tractable; normalization steps ensure robust comparisons and compact representations, with a fallback guaranteeing a result even if no candidate improves the ratio. Validation confirms correctness and test-passing, though the search-space is large and highly heuristic-driven.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 148 - Patch Name rotate_offsets_prune - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Greedy FirstFit Color with Waves**
- **Implementation**: FirstFit coloring stores each color as a left-sorted list of intervals and inserts using bisect, checking only the predecessor and successor for conflicts; intervals are mapped to a compact integer grid and omega is computed with a memoized sweep-line, while a recursive base pattern is built and augmented with short wave intervals followed by conservative pruning.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.60 achieved on 596 intervals.
- **Feedback**: The implementation uses targeted optimizations (neighbor checks, memoization) to keep conflict tests cheap, and explores augmentation via carefully chosen wave insertions while preserving the omega bound; pruning then preserves the observed color-to-omega ratio, yielding a deterministic yet exploratory construction.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 149 - Patch Name add_extra_last_option - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Open-Interval Pattern Builder**
- **Implementation**: Core logic constructs interval patterns via a recursive 4-copy + 4-blocker expansion, parameterized by seeds, offsets, blockers, translations, and anchors. Each candidate is evaluated with FirstFit color count and omega computed by a sweep, followed by normalization and a conservative pruning step; a guarded exhaustive search with a baseline fallback ensures a final interval set.
- **Performance**: The intended objective is a zero-sum-like score (score maximum at 0.0); the search space is aggressively pruned to avoid explosion, but the overall evaluation reports the program is incorrect and does not pass tests.
- **Feedback**: The approach relies on a large, parameterized exploration of geometric patterns, which is computationally heavy and brittle; scoring (cols/om with a tiny penalty) and the final pruning can misalign with validation criteria, and some configuration-handling logic (e.g., augment_first_level_offsets) is fragile across input shapes, contributing to instability and test failures.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 150 - Patch Name cycle_offsets_blockers_prune_depth5 - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Baseline + Corridor-Wave Interval Coloring**

- **Implementation**: Builds a strong baseline with a 4-copy/4-blocker recursion, then augments it via corridor-waves that carefully preserve the clique number. Uses open-interval representations, a sweep-based clique number, and coverage cells to guide augmentations; includes normalization, multiple baseline offsets, and a greedy final selection among variants.

- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.60; num_intervals: 596; alg: 13; opt: 5. Program is correct and passes all validation tests.

- **Feedback**: The approach effectively combines exact interval analysis (clique number, coverage cells, first-fit conflicts) with heuristic augmentation (corridor waves and multi-wave strategies) and multi-baseline exploration to improve color counts without increasing omega. While strong, further tuning (core construction, shrink steps, or more aggressive baseline variants) could potentially yield additional gains.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 151 - Patch Name multi_run_waves_and_relaxed_gate - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Adversarial Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Uses overlaps, First-Fit color counting, and clique-number computation to measure interval graphs; evolves a set of intervals by expanding into four shifted copies with adversarial interleaving, appends blockers to constrain omega, and applies pruning that preserves clique number and FF color count, followed by normalization to small integers.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 1.67; number of intervals: 57; algorithm rounds: 4; alg: 10; opt: 6.
- **Feedback**: The pruning strategy preserves key invariants (clique number and FF colorability) while aggressively reducing the set, and the adversarial expansion + blockers effectively shape the interval structure; overall, the implementation is reported as correct and passes validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 153 - Patch Name interleave_overlap_base - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Recursive Interval Pattern Synthesis**
- **Implementation**: Recursively expands a base seed into multiple copies with blockers per level, controlled by translation, blocker_anchor, schedule, interleave, and reverse_alt options; a memoized build_pattern caches identical patterns across parameter combinations, and evaluate uses clique_number (omega) and FirstFit colors to score patterns, followed by normalization to an integer grid and aggressive pruning to shrink the final set without metric loss.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.60; intervals produced: 596 (with the explicit interval list shown in run results).
- **Feedback**: The approach achieves a high score with a compact 596-interval solution; memoization and deterministic pruning effectively reduce the search space and final size while preserving clique and color metrics, and the final normalization aids reproducibility on a compact grid. The implementation correctly handles open-interval overlap for omega computation and includes a robust fallback baseline to ensure a valid result.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 152 - Patch Name cache_and_pattern_cache_prune - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adversarial Interval Construction via Tiling and Pruning**
- **Implementation**: The code builds intervals adversarially using four-copy tiling with blockers (expand_once) and cycles through four offset patterns; it maintains a fast FirstFit coloring (firstfit_colors) with end-point tracking, computes the clique number (clique_number) via a sweep-line, and applies greedy per-level pruning (prune_strict_floats) that preserves both the current FirstFit color count and ω. Endpoints are normalized to a compact even grid and reduced by gcd (normalize_intervals). An unused overlaps helper is present but not used by the core construction.
- **Performance**: Composite score reported as 1.17; the run produced 13 intervals (example list shown) with algorithmic level 7 and optimum 6 (alg: 7; opt: 6).
- **Feedback**: The approach robustly preserves key invariants (FirstFit colors and clique number) while aggressively pruning to keep only essential intervals, and the tiling-plus-blockers strategy yields predictable adversarial structure. Minor note: there is dead code (overlaps) that isn’t exercised. Overall, the implementation is correct and passes validation tests, producing a compact interval set.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 154 - Patch Name interval_tiling_cycle - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Recursive Interval Tilings**
- **Implementation**: Builds a k-level tiling by repeatedly copying the current interval set with level-specific offset patterns, inserting a deterministic wave of short blocking intervals, and adding cross-copy blockers. After four levels, it normalizes all endpoints to a compact integer grid by mapping unique endpoints to 0,2,4,... and dividing by the gcd of all endpoints when possible.
- **Performance**: Generates 936 intervals; final normalization yields a small-grid integer representation. The run returns the interval set via a deterministic, repeatable process (with 12/8-like evaluation tags observed in the run data).
- **Feedback**: The approach is correct and passes validation tests, producing a reproducible, grid-aligned interval set. Suggestions for improvement include clarifying the intent of the tiling/wave choices and possibly refactoring for readability and memory efficiency.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 156 - Patch Name tiling_wave_generator - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Beam-based FirstFit interval construction**
- **Implementation**: A deterministic, multi-stage pipeline generates interval sets via a beam-search skeleton using tiled copies and blockers, followed by wave-based augmentation under omega constraints, and finally witness-preserving pruning; all coordinates are normalized to a compact integer grid for stability.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 1.17; num_intervals: 44; intervals: [(6, 8), (22, 24), (4, 12), (18, 26), (10, 16), (14, 20), (50, 52), (46, 54), (40, 44), (42, 48), (4, 30), (36, 56), (28, 34), (32, 38), (88, 90), (84, 92), (78, 82), (80, 86), (74, 94), (68, 72), (70, 76), (0, 58), (64, 94), (56, 62), (60, 66), (136, 138), (132, 140), (126, 130), (128, 134), (122, 142), (116, 120), (118, 124), (112, 142), (106, 110), (108, 114), (94, 98), (104, 144), (96, 102), (100, 142), (0, 2), (0, 2), (0, 2), (0, 2), (0, 2)]; alg: 7; opt: 6
- **Feedback**: The approach combines a reproducible beam-search skeleton with targeted wave-augmentation and witness-aware pruning to balance interval count against color-omega efficiency. Sensitivity to hyperparameters (depth, beam width, step limits) suggests room for adaptive tuning and potential improvements in pruning aggressiveness or alternative tiling/blocker templates.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 157 - Patch Name beam_tower_wave_search - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Multi-pattern Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: The code provides deterministic helpers: firstfit_colors simulates FirstFit by tracking per-color last_end; clique_number computes omega via a sweep; _normalize_grid maps endpoints to an increasing even-integer grid. build_candidate recursively constructs translated copies and blockers under left/center alignment and multiple offset patterns; a parameter sweep over depth, schedule, translation, and offsets selects the best by cols/omega, with a fallback baseline and final normalization.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.60; result includes 596 intervals as listed.
- **Feedback**: The method effectively diversifies geometry via left/center translations and multiple offset schedules and keeps coordinates compact with grid normalization, plus a fallback baseline to guarantee a valid result. The search space is combinatorial and influences runtime, so pruning or heuristics could further improve performance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 158 - Patch Name add_interleaved_schedule_and_halfstep_offsets - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Recursive Interval Pattern Synthesis**
- **Implementation**: Builds open intervals via a 4-copy recursive expansion with 4 blockers per level, parameterized over offsets, blocker templates, translations, and depth. It evaluates candidates using a FirstFit coloring (interval graphs) and a clique-number sweep (omega), then normalizes endpoints to a compact integer grid. A dense parameter sweep prunes oversized instances and selects the best by score (colors/omega) with tie-breakers for smaller size and more colors.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 2.60 with 596 intervals in the final set; the sweep explores many configurations but caps growth (size bound) to keep runtime reasonable.
- **Feedback**: The approach is correct and validation-passing, with deterministic exploration and straightforward heuristics (score = colors/omega with small size penalty and tie-breakers). The implementation carefully preserves open-interval overlap during evaluation and uses integer-grid normalization for compact representation.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 159 - Patch Name permute_copies_ff_variants - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Frontier-Preserving Interval Pattern**
- **Implementation**: Uses a normalization step that maps endpoints to evenly spaced coordinates and reduces by gcd, then builds interval patterns recursively with offsets, blockers, and waves. It evaluates patterns via offline clique (ω) and FirstFit colors (FF), selects the best by maximizing FF/ω and minimizing interval count, and applies a two-stage frontier-preserving pruning before final normalization.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 1.00; num_intervals: 6; intervals: [(9, 11), (7, 10), (6, 8), (0, 4), (3, 5), (1, 2)]; alg: 2; opt: 2
- **Feedback**: The approach robustly explores depth, offset templates, blockers, and anchor choices to optimize FF/ω, with frontier-preserving pruning maintaining essential structure while reducing size. It passes validation tests and yields a compact, high-ratio solution, though the exhaustive search could be computationally intensive for larger parameter spaces.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 160 - Patch Name evolved_interval_adversary - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Multilevel Interval Generator for FF/omega**
- **Implementation**: The program builds k-level interval patterns by recursively tiling scaled copies of a base interval set using deterministic per-level offsets (offsets_cycle), a cycle of blocker templates (blockers_cycle), and alternating anchoring (left/center). It exhaustively evaluates multiple configurations across depths, schedules ('after','before','split','vary'), and an extra_first option, using firstfit_colors to measure FirstFit performance and clique_number to measure omega, then selects the best ratio with tie-breaks and falls back to a baseline construction if needed.
- **Performance**: Score 2.50 achieved with 148 intervals generated.
- **Feedback**: Deterministic tiling-cycle mutations plus alternating anchoring effectively increase FirstFit performance while keeping omega small; broader schedule exploration adds robustness, though the approach relies on handcrafted patterns and a modest search space. The evaluation indicates the method is correct and passes validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 161 - Patch Name per_level_offsets_blocker_variation - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Recursive Interval Construction for FirstFit Adversary**
- **Implementation**: Builds a recursive gadget by starting from (0.0, 1.0) and, for a given number of iterations, replacing the current set T with four translated/scaled copies plus four long connector intervals. Offsets are chosen via a delta-scaled pattern that alternates each iteration, and endpoints are normalized to a compact integer grid by mapping unique endpoints to increasing even integers.
- **Performance**: With default 4 iterations, the run yields 596 intervals and a combined score of 2.60; the evaluation reports alg: 13 and opt: 5.
- **Feedback**: The approach produces a large, structured adversarial interval family that preserves a small clique while amplifying FirstFit behavior; the implementation passes all validation tests and provides explicit interval data for evaluation.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 162 - Patch Name shrink_base_seed_singleton - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Tiling-Cycle Interval Optimizer with Pruning**
- **Implementation**: Builds candidate interval sets via a multi-layer tiling cycle using four offset patterns and fixed blockers, exploring variations (depth 4/5, extra edge blocks, and three scheduling modes: interleaved, split, after). It then normalizes endpoints with grid compression and gcd reduction, evaluates using a first-fit colorization and maximum overlap (omega), and prunes long intervals greedily to preserve a target ratio.
- **Performance**: Performs a bounded search over 24 configurations per depth (plus fallback), selecting the best ratio of colors to overlap and then pruning to produce a compact, normalized interval set; the evaluation in the run reports 3 intervals found ([(4,5),(2,3),(0,1)]) with a combined score of 1.00 and both algorithm and optimization marked as optimal.
- **Feedback**: The approach yields a compact, valid solution and passes validation tests, leveraging normalization and a ratio-driven pruning heuristic. Potential improvements include exploring different first-fit orderings to reduce order dependence and tightening pruning for larger search spaces.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 163 - Patch Name tiled_cycle_evolve - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Adversarial Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Builds a recursive, pattern-driven sequence of intervals. Starts with T = [(0.0, 1.0)], cycles through four copy patterns A–D, expands T by affine-transforming prior intervals per iteration, appends four fixed blocks, and repeats for the given iterations. After finishing, performs coordinate compression on all endpoints to produce compact, integer-valued intervals.

- **Performance**: Combined score 2.17 with 596 intervals produced; implementation is correct and passes all validation tests.

- **Feedback**: The four-pattern cycling increases adversarial diversity while preserving omega, and coordinate compression keeps endpoints compact and deterministic; the approach yields a large, structured interval set suitable for evaluating FirstFit behavior.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 164 - Patch Name pattern-cycle-ff-omega - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Patterned Interval Evolver**
- **Implementation**: Implements open-interval handling with a compact integer-grid normalization (endpoints mapped to even grid, optional gcd shrinking), a fast first-fit color allocator using per-color sorted-Left arrays, and a sweep-line omega (clique) estimator. A recursive pattern builder expands copies and blockers across depths, with a deterministic blueprint search over seeds, depths, offsets, and blockers, followed by ratio-based pruning to trim blockers before final normalization.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.0; the evaluation indicates the approach is incorrect and fails the validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The deterministic search space is relatively small yet not guaranteed to reach optimal patterns, and pruning based on a fixed target ratio may discard promising candidates. The approach relies on several heuristic choices (pattern expansion, blocker scaling, and fallback canonical construction) that do not ensure correctness under validation, though the implementation remains coherent and deterministic.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 165 - Patch Name modular_blockbuilder - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block pattern for FirstFit interval coloring**
- **Implementation**: Builds a recursive four-copy + four-blocker interval pattern, then normalizes endpoints onto a compact integer grid. It simulates FirstFit coloring, computes omega via a sweep-line, augments with short "waves" of new intervals while controlling omega, and finally applies a conservative pruning pass to preserve the observed FF/omega ratio before returning normalized intervals.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.67; intervals generated: 2388 (with algorithmic settings shown as alg: 16; opt: 6).
- **Feedback**: The approach is heuristic and the overall program is incorrect and does not pass all validation tests; the augmentation/pruning workflow relies on ad-hoc choices that do not guarantee correctness or robustness across test cases.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 166 - Patch Name increase_depth_for_pattern - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Recursive Pattern Augmentation for FirstFit Coloring**
- **Implementation**: Builds a base interval pattern via a recursive four-copy plus four-blocker construction, then normalizes to an integer grid. It uses a memory-efficient FirstFit coloring (colors stored as left-sorted intervals with predecessor/successor conflict checks), memoized omega computation, and an augmentation loop that inserts short "wave" intervals while constraining omega; finally, it applies a conservative pruning pass before returning the result.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.60 with 596 intervals, employing wave-based augmentation and careful pruning to raise FirstFit colors while keeping the clique number bounded.
- **Feedback**: The approach effectively leverages pattern synthesis, greedy coloring, and targeted insertions to improve FF color usage under omega constraints; the solution is deterministic and passes validation, though some components (e.g., compute_coverage_map) are unused and could be trimmed to simplify maintenance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 167 - Patch Name cycle_offsets_per_level - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Wave-based Interval Evolver with Pruning**
- **Implementation**: Recursive _build(level, pattern_idx) tiles the previous level's intervals using cyclic PATTERNS, offsets them by delta, and injects BLOCKERS scaled to the current span, optionally adding short and long waves depending on level; results are cached with lru_cache, then _prune performs a single-pass left-to-right removal based on a ratio of ff_count over omega_open on grid-normalized intervals before final normalization.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.00; num_intervals=2; intervals=[(4, 6), (0, 2)]; alg=1; opt=1.
- **Feedback**: The approach yields a small, deterministic solution via pattern-based construction and caching, with pruning driven by a ratio objective and grid normalization to simplify overlap computations; however, the design tightly depends on a fixed depth and predefined patterns, which may limit generalization.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 168 - Patch Name cycled_wave_prune - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: FirstFit Interval Forcer**
- **Implementation**: The code deterministically explores a compact space of interval patterns by layering depth, pattern cycles (canonical/alt patterns and rotor cycles), blocker templates, scheduling orders, optional extra copies, and blocker anchoring. It simulates exact FirstFit coloring and computes the clique number via a sweep-line; it then normalizes coordinates to an increasing even grid and selects the best candidate by maximizing the color/omega ratio.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.60; 596 intervals are generated in the best run (with alg: 13; opt: 5 reported in the evaluation).
- **Feedback**: The approach yields a strong best candidate through exhaustive, deterministic exploration of a compact pattern space, with normalization aiding compact representation; however, the nested loops could be computationally intensive, suggesting potential pruning or caching for scaling.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 169 - Patch Name rotor_anchor_sandwich_search - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Interval Gadgets for FirstFit Coloring**
- **Implementation**: _normalize_grid_ maps unique endpoints to a compact integer grid by assigning increasing even integers to sorted endpoints, preserving order. _construct_intervals_ builds an iterative gadget: start with T = [(0.0, 1.0)], and for each iteration create S by translating five copies (iteration 0) or four copies (later iterations) of T using iteration-specific offsets scaled by delta (hi - lo); append four long blockers per iteration to couple copies without increasing clique, then set T = S. After all iterations, normalize to integers if requested.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.80; 660 intervals are generated and, after normalization, coordinates are integers on a compact grid.
- **Feedback**: Implementation is correct and passes validation tests; the gadget construction successfully pressures FirstFit to use many colors while keeping clique size controlled, though the large interval count and expanded coordinate range suggest room for optimization in offset/blocker choices.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 170 - Patch Name dynamic_offsets_normalized - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Template Interval Optimizer**
- **Implementation**: Builds a compact integer grid of intervals, normalizes endpoints, and simulates FirstFit coloring via per-color end tracking. It generates a family of k-level recursive templates with configurable translations, weaving, blockers, and arrival orders, then exhaustively evaluates candidates using clique numbers and FirstFit color counts to pick the best, with a deterministic fallback pattern if needed.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 1.80 with 596 intervals in the final result.
- **Feedback**: The approach uses a deterministic, bounded configuration space and lightweight helpers to rapidly compare candidates; a fallback canonical pattern ensures a result even if the search space yields nothing optimal, and validation confirms correctness for the evaluated instance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 171 - Patch Name weave_and_reverse_odd_levels_search - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Deterministic Interval Sequence Synthesis**
- **Implementation**: Implements open-interval packing with a deterministic expansion strategy: start from base seeds, generate copies and blockers per level, optionally add waves, and combine according to schedule and interleave. It evaluates interval sets using omega (clique number) and First-Fit color ratio with memoization by a canonical interval signature, and prunes using a two-stage, pivot-protected scheme.
- **Performance**: Performance yields a maximum score of 1.00 with 85 intervals produced and validated against tests.
- **Feedback**: Memoization by signature and two-stage pruning speed the search; deterministic exploration yields a high-quality interval set and passes validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 172 - Patch Name quadwave_pruner_v2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: EVOLVE-BLOCK Interval Pattern Optimizer**
- **Implementation**: The code generates interval patterns using a hierarchical tiling generator (build_pattern) with wave and blocker augmentations, then prunes candidate sets via two stages (prune_stage1 removing longest intervals while preserving chromatic and clique numbers, prune_stage2 using a witness point). Intervals are normalized to a canonical integer form, memoized evaluations (evaluate_cached) avoid recomputation, and a broad parameter sweep (base seeds, blockers, translations, anchors, waves, eps, depths) drives construction. A fallback classic tiling path ensures a result if optimization fails.
- **Performance**: Final run yields 16 intervals with a combined score of 1.00; reported metrics show alg: 6 and opt: 6, indicating the solution matches the evaluation target in the given test.
- **Feedback**: The two-stage pruning effectively reduces instance size while preserving key graph properties (chromatic and clique numbers); normalization and caching improve stability and speed across patterns. The approach explores a wide pattern space but relies on input order for the greedy first-fit coloring, and there is a safety cap to bound runtime with a fallback path.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 173 - Patch Name enhanced_evolver - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Recursive four-copy interval expansion with blockers**
- **Implementation**: Uses a canonical unit interval T = [(0.0, 1.0)] and repeatedly expands by placing four translated copies of T at offset bases (2,6,10,14) or (1,5,9,13) depending on iteration parity, with an optional extra copy on the first iteration. It also appends four long blocker intervals to connect distant parts. Endpoints are then normalized to a compact integer grid by mapping unique endpoints to increasing even integers via _normalize_grid. The process alternates offset patterns (alt_offsets) and toggles an extra copy (extra_offset) on the first iteration; final output is optionally on the compact grid. The main entry point run_experiment returns construct_intervals with default 4 iterations and normalization enabled.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.60 with 660 intervals produced, reflecting substantial growth in interval count across iterations while preserving a normalized grid layout.
- **Feedback**: The design achieves high color usage under FirstFit by combining recursive expansion with blockers and a normalization step for compact coordinates. The alternating offsets and added extra copy drive diversity and density, but also substantially inflate the interval set, which may impact performance for larger iteration counts. The implementation is self-contained, deterministic, and outputs open-interval-like pairs on a compact integer grid.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 174 - Patch Name alternate_offsets - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic recursive interval template generator**
- **Implementation**: Normalization maps endpoints to a compact integer grid; FirstFit uses per-color last_end and omega is computed by a sweep for open intervals. Templates are built via a recursive cycle with copies, blockers, and optional short/long waves, followed by deterministic two-stage pruning that preserves a target ratio and a parameter-sweep with evaluation caching.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 1.50; num_intervals: 5; intervals: [(14, 16), (10, 18), (0, 8), (6, 12), (2, 4)]; alg: 3; opt: 2
- **Feedback**: The approach yields a correct result and passes all validation tests; pruning and caching help maintain efficiency while preserving the target ratio, with a conservative size cap to bound the search.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 175 - Patch Name cyclewave4 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Pattern Optimizer**
- **Implementation**: Uses open-interval overlap tests and FirstFit coloring to evaluate arrival-order interval sets; constructs rich base patterns through two recursive builders (build_recursive_pattern and build_recursive_pattern_cycled) with multiple seeds, depths, offsets, and blockers, then normalizes to a compact integer grid. Augments via deterministic wave additions guided by a coverage map while enforcing a target clique number, followed by conservative pruning to preserve observed FirstFit/omega ratios.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.60 with 596 intervals; the approach is deterministic and reproducible due to fixed seeds and ordering of candidate exploration.
- **Feedback**: The multi-phase pattern generation plus wave-based augmentation effectively increases color usage under omega constraints, with pruning ensuring ratio preservation. Potential performance sensitivity arises from repeated clique and FirstFit computations and the breadth of candidate exploration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 176 - Patch Name phased_cycles_and_wave_bias - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Corridor-Augmented Interval Evolve**

- **Implementation**: The code normalizes interval endpoints onto a compact even integer grid, uses a fast First-Fit coloring via per-color last-end tracking, and computes omega with a sweep that processes right endpoints before left ones for open intervals. It builds a recursive baseline with scaled copies and blockers, using multiple scheduling modes, and then augments the result with corridor waves through a multi-step wave-addition strategy and heuristic selection.

- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.60; produced 596 intervals, with a detailed interval list generated by the optimization loop.

- **Feedback**: The approach is correct and passes all validation tests; the combination of normalization, baseline construction, and corridor-wave augmentation yields a substantial set of intervals and a favorable balance between coloring efficiency and overlap constraints.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 177 - Patch Name wave_ff_crossover - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Evolve-Block Interval Designer**
- **Implementation**: Builds open intervals via a recursive, pattern-driven generator, normalizes endpoints to a compact grid, and evaluates candidates with a deterministic FirstFit coloring and open-interval clique number. It enumerates a small, fixed set of pattern configurations (k-depths, offsets, translations, blocker anchoring), scores each by the ratio of FirstFit colors to clique number, and keeps the best, with a fallback canonical pattern if nothing improves the score.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 2.60 with 596 intervals; evaluation employs a 5000-interval cap to prune explosive patterns and uses normalization before coloring/clique analysis.
- **Feedback**: The approach yields reproducible results through deterministic pattern enumeration and simple heuristics, but is limited by its fixed pattern space and heuristics (ratio-based scoring, tie-breaks). The normalization and pruning help manage complexity, though they may exclude potentially better configurations outside the predefined pattern set.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 178 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Pattern Optimizer**
- **Implementation**: Deterministic candidate generator builds multi-level recursive interval patterns using a base interval (0,1), a 4-blocker template, and four scheduling modes (after/before/split/interleaved). Each level scales by the current range (delta) and anchors either to the left edge or the center, with optional extra copies on the first iteration and center/left translation to break symmetry. Endpoints are normalized to increasing even integers, and candidates are evaluated via in-block FirstFit (color count) and omega (clique number) computations; the best candidate is chosen by maximizing the color/omega ratio, with tie-breaks on smaller size and larger color count.
- **Performance**: The search explores a combinatorial set of patterns (depth choices, schedules, translations, offset patterns, and a boolean extra copy) while capping candidate size to 4000 intervals. The final run reports a combined score of 2.60 with 596 intervals produced; a robust normalization ensures comparability across candidates.
- **Feedback**: The implementation uses a well-defined, deterministic evaluation loop and multiple symmetry-breaking strategies (left/center anchoring, varied offsets) to diversify candidates while avoiding duplicates. The ratio-based objective (colors/omega) aligns with maximizing FirstFit efficiency under adversarial-like constructions. While effective, the approach is heuristic and potentially heavy due to broad candidate generation; pruning, caching of equivalent patterns, or pruning via upper bounds could improve scalability. The fallback path guarantees a result even if the search misses all candidates.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 179 - Patch Name interleaved_center_translation_and_normalized_search - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Pattern for FirstFit Interval Coloring**
- **Implementation**: Builds interval sets via a multi-copy plus blockers scheme with recursive expansion; supports configurable scheduling (after/before/split), interleaving (block/zip), translations, and reversed copies; uses a sweep to compute omega, FirstFit to compute colors, and a normalization step (doubling, shifting, gcd shrink) to keep coordinates small and integral.
- **Performance**: The search yields a combined score of 2.60 over 596 intervals, selecting among many blueprint configurations and applying a two-phase pruning (strict then relaxed) to preserve the ratio while reducing count.
- **Feedback**: The implementation carefully handles open-interval overlaps (tie-breaking right endpoint before left), and normalization is robust against fractional shifts. The two-phase pruning effectively reduces interval count without degrading the targeted color/omega ratio, though the design-space exploration is large and can be expensive; a fallback ensures a reasonable baseline if the search fails.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 180 - Patch Name translation_and_blocker_right_support - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Recursive Pattern Coloring**
- **Implementation**: Constructs a recursive Figure-4 style interval pattern by placing four copies plus blockers across multiple depths with varied schedules, translations, and extra copies; normalizes endpoints to a compact integer grid, then solves with FirstFit coloring (efficient per-color insertion with neighbor conflict checks) and a memoized clique-number computation; augments the pattern with short "waves" of intervals and conservatively prunes while preserving FirstFit/omega ratio to select a compact, high-coloring instance.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.60; 596 intervals generated; validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: The design leverages extensive parameter sweeping, caching, and heuristic augmentation to boost colors under controlled omega, but relies on a large, multi-parameter search space and numerous heuristics that may impact clarity and speed; unused helpers (e.g., compute_coverage_map) suggest some dead code paths that could be trimmed to streamline performance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 181 - Patch Name scheduled_builder_and_wider_wave_search - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Iterative FirstFit interval adversary construction**
- **Implementation**: Starts with T = [(0, 1)] and, over four iterations, scales and shifts all intervals using predefined offset patterns and two wave templates, appending transformed copies, fixed extra blocks, and wave-induced intervals to form the next T; returns the final interval list. The construction is deterministic and mirrors a referenced adversarial scheme intended to stress FirstFit without increasing omega.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.0; the program is incorrect and does not pass validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The implementation enacts a structured, paper-inspired interval expansion but likely deviates from the intended construction (e.g., potential duplicates from wave insertions, unclear open/closed semantics, and lack of validation against the target criteria), resulting in failure on tests. The fixed four-iteration design and deterministic patterns may not produce the required coloring/overlap properties.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 182 - Patch Name add_wave_variation_and_offset_cycle - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Recursive Interval Packing for FirstFit**

- **Implementation**: Builds intervals via recursive 4-copy expansion with long blockers per level (Figure-4 motif), supporting scheduling variants ('after', 'before', 'split') and an optional extra copy on the first level; anchors translation and blockers as 'left' or 'center'; uses a fast FirstFit simulator (per-color last_end) and an omega computation via event-based sweep for open intervals, then normalizes endpoints to a compact integer grid by mapping to even coordinates and dividing by gcd; includes size and candidate limits with a deterministic fallback baseline expansion if needed.

- **Performance**: Combined objective score 2.60, producing 660 normalized intervals under a bounded, deterministic grid-search with MAX_CANDIDATES=200 and SIZE_CAP=4000.

- **Feedback**: The recursive blocker/copy strategy effectively explores coupling across layers to improve FirstFit/omega ratio, while normalization ensures compact, comparable representations; a guarded fallback guarantees results even if the search space is pruned early, though results are sensitive to parameter choices and may vary with different seeds or limits.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 183 - Patch Name ff_interval_crossover - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Four-Copy Blocker Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Builds a fractal-like sequence by starting from a unit interval and, at each iteration, replacing the current template with four translated copies plus four fixed blockers. Offsets for the copies come from four predefined patterns that cycle each level, and endpoints are optionally normalized to a compact integer grid by mapping unique endpoints to increasing even integers.
- **Performance**: Combined score: 2.17; 596 intervals generated (producing a large, but grid-normalized, interval set).
- **Feedback**: The approach is deterministic and reproducible, leveraging recursive expansion and normalization to stress FirstFit coloration. Endpoint normalization effectively controls coordinate growth, though the interval count grows quickly with iterations, making the method computationally heavy at higher depths.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 184 - Patch Name cycle_offset_patterns - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: FirstFit/omega Interval Designer**
- **Implementation**: Implements a modular, template-based generator that builds candidate interval sets T using a fixed set of offsets, translations, and scheduling variants, then evaluates each template with a sweep-line clique-number (omega) and FirstFit color count, selecting the best by color/omega ratio; it also attempts a corridor-wave augmentation to improve color count without increasing omega and normalizes endpoints to a compact grid. The search space is intentionally small and deterministic, with a canonical fallback pattern if no candidate beats baseline.
- **Performance**: The run achieves a combined score of 2.60, producing 596 intervals in the final template.
- **Feedback**: Strength lies in the controlled, grid-based template exploration plus augmentation to squeeze more colors without affecting omega; the approach is deterministic and dependency-free, though improvements could come from expanding the template space or refining augmentation heuristics.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 185 - Patch Name corridor_waves_augment - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Recursive 4-copy Block-Evolve Interval Search**
- **Implementation**: Builds candidate open interval sets via a 4-copy recursive expansion with 4 blockers per level using build_pattern (translation and blocker_anchor variants). Evaluation relies on clique_number (open-interval sweep) to get omega and firstfit_colors to get the chromatic number, scoring as cols/omega with a tiny size penalty; endpoints are normalized to a compact integer grid. A patch block introduces a deterministic_prune function (not wired into the flow) and contains patch-style markers that would break execution; a fallback baseline is provided if no best candidate is found.
- **Performance**: Score maximization target is 0.0; the search is combinatorial with multiple nested parameter sweeps and a size cap (4^k)*(len(base)+2) > 3000 to prune growth, but overall the run is heavy and the patch/syntax issues likely prevent correct execution in practice.
- **Feedback**: Evaluation reports the program as incorrect and failing validation tests; key issues include syntactic patch markers that would break Python, the pruning function not being invoked, and a potentially misaligned objective (maximizing FF/OPT) that can skew results. Recommend removing patch artifacts, wiring deterministic_prune into the pipeline, ensuring best is always well-defined, and tightening the objective/validation checks with unit tests for core routines (omega/FirstFit) and normalization.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 186 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Recursive K-Copy Interval Packing**
- **Implementation**: Normalizes endpoints to even integers while preserving order, then evaluates candidate interval sets generated by a recursive k-copy + 4-blocker construction. It explores a parameter grid over depth, anchor starts, blocker templates, scheduling modes, translation modes, and extra offset options, using omega-open (maximum open overlap) and a first-fit count to pick the best ratio of colors to omega.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.60; 596 intervals produced; the search is pruned to keep depth under a practical bound (pruning condition 4**d * 8 <= 5000) and falls back to a canonical candidate if no better arrangement is found.
- **Feedback**: The implementation robustly explores a diverse set of construction strategies (after/before/split/interleaved scheduling with left/center translations) and yields a correct solution that passes validation tests; however, it relies on an exhaustive parameter sweep whose cost scales with depth and template complexity.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 187 - Patch Name improved_interval_adversary - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Heuristic Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: The code defines deterministic helpers (overlaps, firstfit_colors, clique_number) and a core candidate builder (build_candidate) that recursively constructs multi-level intervals. It explores a large parametric space: varying depth k, offset backbones, blocker templates, arrival schedules (after/before/split/mix), interleaving (block/zip), and optional extra copies on the first level, then evaluates each candidate with FirstFit (color count) and open-interval clique number (omega), selecting the best by colors/omega with tie-breakers; a baseline fallback is provided if no candidate yields a result.
- **Performance**: The evaluation reports a combined score of 2.60 over 596 intervals, after exploring a wide grid of candidate configurations; the approach is deterministic and reproducible, but the candidate space and O(n^2) FirstFit checks imply substantial runtime for larger instances.
- **Feedback**: The method robustly mixes multiple structural variants to find high color/omega ratios, which can yield strong theoretical gaps, but the exhaustive grid search is expensive; potential improvements include pruning the search space, prioritizing promising templates, or parallelizing candidate evaluation to accelerate exploration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 188 - Patch Name zip_and_blocker_sweep - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Four-pattern FirstFit interval tiling generator**
- **Implementation**: Cycles four offset patterns (A–D) across levels, with an optional extra offset on the first level, and uses a small deterministic perturbation to each copy’s placement. On alternating levels it interleaves blockers and reverses copy order; each level builds upon the previous level’s intervals by translating them, deduplicates identical intervals while preserving arrival order, then normalizes endpoints to a compact even-integer grid.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 1.57; 660 intervals are produced (a large, varied set with endpoints scaled to a compact grid).
- **Feedback**: The design increases FirstFit color usage by introducing pattern diversity, perturbations, and interleaved blockers to create cross-level overlaps, while deduplication and normalization keep the instance compact and deterministic. Validation shows correctness and tests pass; potential improvements include tuning perturbation and interleave parameters to balance color growth with instance size.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 189 - Patch Name interleaved_perturbed_backbone - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Skeleton with FirstFit Waves**
- **Implementation**: Builds a 4-copy skeleton by rotating through four offset patterns and applying a deterministic perturbation, then recursively expands this blueprint. It deterministically augments intervals with up to two “waves” via a FirstFit coloring constraint that preserves omega (maximum overlap). Evaluation is memoized for first-fit colors and omega-open, followed by a greedy pruning pass that removes long intervals if the color/omega ratio stays above a target. The best pattern is normalized to integer coordinates. 
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.0; the program is stated as incorrect and does not pass all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The approach is heuristic and brittle: multiple hard-coded patterns, ad-hoc perturbation, and a discrete wave insertion that relies on precise color-coverage checks may fail validation. Potential issues include the possibility of best_inst remaining None if all patterns yield opt==0, and reliance on several floating-point jitter steps (e.g., 1e-3 tweaks) that can cause edge-case failures. Overall, the design uses caching and greedy pruning but lacks robust correctness guarantees and explicit test-alignment checks.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 190 - Patch Name modular_interval_adversary - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Open-Interval FF Coloring**
- **Implementation**: Implements FirstFit coloring on open intervals with a conservative intra-color overlap check, a sweep-based open-interval clique number, and a recursive 4-copy/4-blocker pattern generator (with options for weaving, translation, and arrival-order scheduling). Includes normalization (scale by 2, translate, gcd shrink) and a two-stage prune (omega-reduction while preserving color count, then ratio-preserving conservative pruning).
- **Performance**: Score 2.60; 596 intervals produced; best found ratio (colors/omega) 13/5 with 13 colors and omega 5.
- **Feedback**: The approach robustly searches a large design space for adversarial interval layouts and applies targeted pruning to improve the FF/omega ratio; effective validation confirms correctness, though the exploration is computationally intensive and relies on multiple heuristic controls to keep the search tractable.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 191 - Patch Name schedule_weave_and_clique_prune - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Adversarial Open-Interval Sequences**
- **Implementation**: Builds adversarial open-interval sequences via a recursive 4-copy + 4-blocker construction, with adjustable depth, schedule (before/split/after) and translation (left/center). It uses helpers to count FirstFit colors (_ff_count) and open-interval ω via a sweep (_omega_open), and then normalizes endpoints onto a compact integer grid (_normalize_grid) before returning. Phase 1 performs a modest parametric sweep over depths, starter sets, blockers, schedules, and translations; Phase 2 extends depth explicitly (iterations+1) with a fixed configuration to try to improve the ratio.

- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 2.67; num_intervals: 2388; the produced interval list is large and the search explores a broad combinatorial space, indicating substantial compute and heuristic tuning.

- **Feedback**: The approach relies on heuristic recursion and grid normalization rather than a proven construction, and the evaluation notes the program is incorrect and does not pass all tests. Likely causes include overfitting to sampled configurations, reliance on specific blocker/translation/schedule combos, and potential edge-case issues in ω/FirstFit calculations or normalization assumptions. The large generated interval set suggests inefficiency and possible fragility across validation scenarios.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 192 - Patch Name tower_depth_extension - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block FirstFit Interval Coloring**
- **Implementation**: Implements FirstFit coloring with per-color interval lists kept sorted by left endpoint; insertion checks only predecessor and successor to detect conflicts, using bisect for position; computes clique number via a sweep-line (with -1 before +1 at ties) and memoizes results; normalizes endpoints to a compact integer grid; builds recursive block-patterns and then searches for wave augmentations plus conservative pruning to boost color usage while restraining omega.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.60 with 596 intervals generated.
- **Feedback**: The design combines greedy FirstFit, recursive pattern generation, and a targeted wave-augmentation search with caching and pruning to improve FF/omega ratio; attention notes include an unused helper (compute_coverage_map) and potential scalability concerns due to the broad search space and extensive interval manipulations.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 193 - Patch Name wave_insertion_positions - Correct Program: True

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Below is a focused analysis anchored in the concrete evaluation results, with emphasis on the current best pattern and how it compares to other evaluated programs. The current best pattern is EVOLVE-BLOCK-START (as described under the Current Best Program), which consistently achieves a frontier around 2.6 (FF ≈ 13 colors, omega ≈ 5) with 596 intervals.

Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Four-copy skeleton with deterministic blockers as the core backbone
  - The best results (EVOLVE-BLOCK-START, Generation 152, and its close variants 158/159/162) rely on a disciplined backbone: at each level, build 4 translated copies plus 4 blocking intervals. This backbone yields a robust frontier (FF/ω ≈ 13/5) and keeps the interval set manageable (596 intervals in the canonical runs). This pattern is repeatedly reproduced across generations with little change to the frontier, indicating it captures the essential constructive space needed to push FF without inflating ω.
  - The same backbone appears in several variants that still hit the 2.60 frontier with 596 intervals, showing its robustness (e.g., EVOLVE-BLOCK-START, Generation 152; Gen 158/159/162 all report the same 596 intervals and frontier).
- Deterministic, depth-bounded exploration with a reliable baseline
  - The success pattern uses a fixed, depth-bounded recursive construction (k around 4) with a canonical fallback baseline. This determinism yields reproducible results and avoids the pitfalls of unbounded or stochastic searches, which in several other attempts either produced invalid results or weaker frontiers.
  - This approach is reinforced by the existence of canonical baselines and consistent re-use of the backbone across generations.
- Endpoint normalization to a compact integer grid, with gcd-based shrinking
  - Normalizing endpoints to compact even integers and then applying gcd-based shrinking stabilizes coordinate growth and keeps comparisons meaningful across depths. The current best runs rely on this normalization to prevent coordinate blow-up, enabling a consistent frontier signal (FF/ω) as the depth increases.
- Frontier-preserving pruning and augmentation concepts
  - The narrative around these results emphasizes pruning that preserves the FF/ω frontier while reducing the total interval count. Variants talk about augmentations or wave-like insertions that attempt to increase color usage without increasing omega, and then prune conservatively to retain the frontier. This pattern helps maintain a high FF relative to ω without ballooning the instance size.
- Caching/memoization hints to accelerate evaluation
  - Although not always explicit in the exact best run, related variants repeatedly emphasize memoization of omega and FirstFit outcomes. This accelerates exploration of many candidate configurations while keeping the frontier estimates stable, allowing deeper, deterministic searches without excessive runtime.

Ineffective Approaches
- Center-anchored growth without backbone discipline
  - Generation 15 (center-anchored growth) produced a large interval set (2,644 intervals) and failed validation, illustrating that unbounded center-focused growth can violate invariants and overwhelm the evaluator.
- Dropping the disciplined backbone
  - Generation 48, which dropped the 4-copy skeleton, produced a large but weaker frontier (660 intervals with a less favorable frontier), showing that the backbone is critical for achieving the strongest frontier.
- Stochastic or non-backbone-driven searches
  - Generation 17 (Deterministic Simulated Annealing) yielded a much weaker frontier (approximately 1.2), indicating poor robustness when exploration lacks the stable backbone.
- Patch artifacts or brittle pruning logic
  - Generation 136 included patch markers in prune logic, breaking execution and yielding a 0.0 score. This demonstrates that pruning must stay consistent with the core data structures to preserve correctness.
- Frontier numbers without correctness
  - Generation 166 reported a higher frontier (2.67) but was invalid; similarly, a separate high-frontier case (Gen 112 ~2.67) was invalid. These show that chasing larger FF values without validating invariants (coloring, open-interval constraints, normalization) can mislead results.

Implementation Insights
- Core backbone: fixed four-copy + four-blocker expansion with delta-based blockers
  - The canonical offsets (2, 6, 10, 14) for the four copies, combined with blockers that span across the four copies (delta*1 to delta*5, delta*4 to delta*9, delta*8 to delta*13, delta*12 to delta*16), form the primary engine behind the strongest frontier. This arrangement reliably yields FF ≈ 13 and ω ≈ 5, driving the ~2.6 frontier in multiple runs.
  - The backbone’s repeatability is evidenced by Gen 152 and its close variants (158/159/162) producing the same 596-interval footprint and frontier, and by Gen 183 achieving the same frontier with a slightly larger 660-interval footprint.
- Deterministic, grid-focused construction with normalization
  - The use of a deterministic, depth-bounded construction (k=4 in the exemplar) and normalization to an integer grid ensures stable, reproducible behavior across runs. Normalization to compact even-integer endpoints, plus gcd shrinking, keeps the numeric scale controlled as the tree grows.
- Efficient coloring/evaluation routines with caching
  - The approach relies on FirstFit coloring and an open-interval omega calculation, often with caching. While the exact best-run’s summary foregrounds the frontier ratio, related variants show that caching omega/FirstFit outcomes substantially reduces repeated work across many candidate patterns, enabling deeper deterministic exploration without prohibitive cost.
- Pruning that preserves frontier signals
  - Frontier-preserving pruning is highlighted as a mechanism to trim the interval count while keeping the meaningful signal (colors relative to omega). This aligns with the observed stability: 596 intervals maintain a potent FF/ω ratio, whereas uncontrolled growth tends to degrade the frontier or correctness (as seen in the ineffective or invalid runs).

Performance Analysis
- Consistent frontier with a compact footprint
  - The canonical best pattern achieves a combined score of 2.60 with 596 intervals and an FF/ω ratio of about 13/5. This frontier is robust across multiple nearby configurations (EVOLVE-BLOCK-START, Generation 152; Gen 158/159/162).
- Scale with backbone, while frontier remains steady
  - Generation 183 shows the same frontier target (2.60) but with 660 intervals, indicating the backbone scales without sacrificing the FF/ω ratio. The backbone’s ability to scale up the interval count while preserving the frontier is a notable pattern.
- Higher frontier attempts can be non-viable or invalid
  - Attempts to push frontier higher (e.g., 2.67) sometimes yield invalid results or break validation, as seen with Generation 166 and the tower-depth-extension variant. This reinforces that frontier magnitude alone is not a reliable quality signal without correctness checks.
- Broad exploration but with reliable baselines
  - A number of alternative approaches (FirstFit-based coloring, wave augmentations, and various scheduling variants) converge around the same 2.60 frontier for 596 intervals, indicating a sweet spot around the 4-copy skeleton with blockers. Attempts to diverge too far (e.g., extreme pattern diversification or patch-artifact-pruned runs) tend to degrade reliability or correctness.

References to specific programs and outcomes
- Current Best Program: EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
  - Score: 2.60; intervals: 596; FF ≈ 13; ω ≈ 5; backbone: 4-copy skeleton + 4 blockers; canonical offsets: (2,6,10,14) for copies; blockers: (1–5), (12–16), (4–9), (8–13) scaled by delta.
- Close family with the same frontier and footprint
  - Generations 152 (the implicit origin of the best pattern) and variants 158, 159, 162: 596 intervals; frontier ≈ 2.60; FF/ω ≈ 13/5.
- Scale-up variant with identical frontier
  - Generation 183: 660 intervals; frontier still 2.60; same backbone behavior.
- Other consistent 2.60 implementations
  - Generations 185, 187, 188, 191, 193 describe methods that converge on 2.60 with 596 intervals, often via deterministic template exploration and normalization strategies similar to the best pattern.
- Non-viable or higher-frontier, invalid outcomes
  - Tower-depth-extension (Gen 192) and tower-like 2.67 attempts: high frontier but incorrect/invalid; Gen 166 also reports 2.67 but invalid.
- Weaker or diverging backbone attempts
  - Four-pattern FirstFit interval tiling (Gen 189): score 1.57; 660 intervals; shows that pattern diversity without the proven backbone reduces effectiveness.
  - Recursive/heuristic attempts without backbone discipline (Gen 186, 190) often report incorrect or 0.0 scores.

In summary:
- The strongest, validated results arise from a disciplined four-copy skeleton with fixed blockers, combined with deterministic depth-bounded exploration, compact grid normalization, and frontier-preserving pruning. This pattern, seen prominently in EVOLVE-BLOCK-START (Generation 152) and reproduced in closely related variants (Gen 158/159/162, Gen 183, Gen 185, Gen 187, Gen 188, Gen 191, Gen 193), yields a robust frontier of ~2.6 (FF ≈ 13, ω ≈ 5) with 596 intervals, and demonstrates a stable, scalable approach to constructing adversarial open-interval layouts that balance color usage and clique size. Attempts to exceed this frontier without preserving correctness tend to become invalid or brittle, underscoring the backbone’s central role in achieving and maintaining the current best performance.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1) Implement a deterministic backbone cycle with small copy perturbations
- Alternate among four fixed copy-offset patterns A, B, C, D for the 4-copy skeleton (A: 2,6,10,14; B: 1,5,9,13; C: 3,7,11,15; D: 0,4,8,12) in a round-robin fashion, and in each mutation apply a tiny deterministic offset to a single copy (delta*epsilon with epsilon in {0.15, 0.25}, rounded to int) while keeping the blocker template anchored as in the canonical skeleton. This preserves the proven backbone while probing nearby geometries that may nudge FF without inflating ω.
- Why it helps: the current best pattern relies on a stable 4-copy skeleton with blockers; cycling patterns plus small, controlled perturbations explores adjacent valid configurations without breaking invariants, matching the robustness seen in Generations 152 and its close variants.

2) Add a deterministic frontier-witness pruning pass
- Introduce a two-stage pruning that is entirely deterministic and frontier-aware: Stage 1 removes intervals that cannot contribute to any frontier witness given the current skeleton and FF/ω target; Stage 2 further prunes intervals that do not participate in any potential frontier path, ensuring no loss of the frontier signal.
- Why it helps: frontier-preserving pruning has consistently reduced the interval footprint while keeping FF/ω stable. A deterministic, witness-based prune should reduce the interval count below 596 where possible while maintaining the validated frontier.

3) Expand pattern-aware memoization for omega/FirstFit results
- Build a canonical pattern signature (normalized backbone pattern + blocker_template_index) and cache omega and FirstFit outcomes per (depth, pattern_signature). Use a bounded, memory-aware cache (e.g., LRU) so results can be reused across mutations that share the same backbone geometry.
- Why it helps: caching localized evaluations accelerates exploration around the strong backbone, enabling deeper or broader mutation searches without recomputation, and increases the chance of discovering marginal frontier gains without correctness loss.

4) Introduce deterministic wave augmentations aligned to delta windows
- Add two deterministic wave templates: a short_wave of length 2–4 and a long_wave of length 6–10, placed deterministically relative to the gaps between 4-copy blocks (e.g., adjacent to inter-copy deltas or blocker overlaps). Alternate wave type on a fixed schedule (e.g., every mutation family) and keep placement rules consistent with the normalized backbone.
- Why it helps: waves have been shown to raise FirstFit colors without increasing omega. Deterministic inclusion of waves expands the constructive space while preserving core invariants, potentially nudging FF upward within the same ω ceiling.

5) Depth-aware skeleton mutations with tiny controlled perturbations and k cycling
- Expand the depth parameter exploration by cycling k in {3, 4, 5} in a deterministic sequence, and apply a tiny offset perturbation to one copy (epsilon in {0.10, 0.20, 0.30}, rounded) plus a minor blocker-anchor tweak. Preserve normalization and gcd shrinking to keep comparisons stable across depths.
- Why it helps: while k=4 is robust, small, deterministic variations in depth and geometry can reveal subtle frontier improvements that stay within the proven backbone, offering a path to potentially higher FF without inflating the interval set.
