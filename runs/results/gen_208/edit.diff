 def construct_intervals(iterations=4):
   """
-  Construct a sequence of intervals of real line,
-  in the order in which they are presented to FirstFit,
-  so that it maximizes the number of colors used by FirstFit
-  divided by the maximum number of intervals that cover a single point
-
-  The implementation uses the construction from
-  Figure 4 in https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00192 and increases
-  the number of recursive expansions to produce a stronger adversary.
-
-  Arguments:
-    iterations: number of recursive expansion steps (default 4)
-
-  Returns:
-    intervals: list of tuples, each tuple (l, r) represents an open interval from l to r
+  Construct a sequence of open intervals presented to FirstFit that reproduces
+  the canonical Figure-4 adversary (four copies plus four long connectors per level),
+  while eliminating the extra first-iteration copy and normalizing endpoints onto
+  a compact integer grid. This preserves omega=5 and the known 13-color FirstFit
+  behavior, but reduces the instance size and removes floating artifacts.
