<NAME>alternate_offsets_and_mid_blockers</NAME>
<DESCRIPTION>
Introduce alternating offset patterns per recursion level to break regularity and add two additional “mid” connectors at each level. By alternating between (2,6,10,14) and (1,5,9,13), we frustrate FirstFit’s ability to reuse color classes across levels. The extra mid-connectors (at multipliers (3,8) and (9,14)) further entangle intervals without raising the maximum clique size, aiming to boost the FirstFit color count relative to ω.
