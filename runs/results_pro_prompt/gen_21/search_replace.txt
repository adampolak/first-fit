<DESCRIPTION>
Checklist:
- Reassess ordering’s impact on FirstFit color blow-up vs. clique number stability
- Restore the canonical recursive order that aligns caps and copies to couple colors across scales
- Validate color usage (FirstFit) and OPT after the change on the same construction
- If improved, lock in identity order; plan future work on parallel seeds and capped towers

Argumentation:
The block_hybrid_order perturbs the carefully engineered recursive order that makes Figure 4’s construction adversarial for FirstFit. Prior metrics show identity order on the same depth-4 fractal achieves alg=13, opt=5 (combined score 2.60), whereas the hybrid reordering drops to alg=11 (combined score 2.20). Returning the identity order re-establishes the multi-scale coupling that forces FirstFit to open more colors while preserving the clique number at 5.

Post-action validation:
With identity order, we expect the evaluator to report alg≈13 and opt=5 on this instance, matching the already-observed best for this construction. Next step: explore parallel seed anchors and block-wise hybrids only after selecting the best-performing global order.
