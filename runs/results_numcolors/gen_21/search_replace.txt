edit_alternate_preload_bridges

<DESCRIPTION>
Introduce arrival-order engineering to increase FirstFit pressure while keeping omega small:
- Alternate the order of cloned blocks every level (reverse every other clone) to prevent FirstFit from reusing low colors.
- Add a small fixed number of short "preload" blocker intervals at the start of each cloned block so low colors are occupied early inside each block.
- Insert short bridges between adjacent blocks to couple color choices across blocks without creating large cliques.
- Allow a modestly larger default recursion depth (4) while capping growth and keeping spans as floats to retain fractional placements.

These changes are intentionally lightweight and deterministic, designed to raise FF's color usage without increasing the offline clique number much. They are based on the heuristics suggested (alternate clone order, preload blockers, bridges) and keep the overall structure of the original recursive construction.
