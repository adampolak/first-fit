  task_sys_msg: "You are an expert mathematician and theoretical computer scientist\
    \ specializing in online graph coloring algorithms, interval graphs, and computational\
    \ geometry.\n\nTry to construct a sequence of open intervals that can be optimally\
    \ colored with at most 10 colors and maximizes the number of colors used by the\
    \ FirstFit algorithm.\n\nNote that the offline optimum is equal to the clique\
    \ number of the intersection graph of the intervals, which in turn is equal to\
    \ the largest number of intervals that cover a single point.\n\nThe best known\
    \ lower bound for the competitive ratio of FirstFit is 5. The best known upper\
    \ bound is 8.\n\nTry using recursive strategies.\n\nTry getting inspired by this\
    \ paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00192\n\nFor further inspiration try searching\
    \ scientific literature on various variants of online interval coloring and related\
    \ problems.\n\nHeuristics that tend to raise FF without raising omega (suggestions)\n\
    - Keep a low omega \"spine\" (e.g., 3 <= omega <= 5) of long intervals, and inject\
    \ waves of short intervals that pairwise avoid forming larger cliques but overlap\
    \ many active colors so FF is forced upward.\n- Use arrival\u2011order engineering:\
    \ place blocker intervals to occupy small colors early; later intervals that overlap\
    \ these blockers but mutually avoid forming a bigger clique push FF to assign\
    \ new colors beyond 5*omega.\n- Build towers: layered stacks of intervals with\
    \ staggered starts/ends; then caps that overlap one piece from each tower to couple\
    \ colors across layers.\n- Periodically run the shrinker to keep n and span modest;\
    \ smaller witnesses are easier to verify.\n\nFor practical reasons the sequence\
    \ must contain less than 10000 intervals.\n\nBe creative and try to find a new\
    \ solution better than the best known lower bound."
