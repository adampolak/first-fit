<NAME>adaptive-extra-rounds KT-press_diff</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Introduce a deterministic, extra-round expansion phase to further pressure FirstFit without increasing omega.
Adds an optional extra_rounds parameter to the main construction, and a helper to perform controlled, additional rounds
using rotated start patterns and the same connector scheme. This preserves determinism while potentially boosting the combined score by expanding the interval set within the same MAX_INTERVALS budget.
