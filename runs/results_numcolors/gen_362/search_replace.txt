adaptive_micro_rounds
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Introduce an adaptive micro-round scheduler to allocate budget for the delta-round micro-block phase. The idea is to perform multiple small micro-rounds when there is ample CAP slack, potentially increasing FirstFit pressure without inflating the clique number. A new flag adaptive_micro (default True) controls this behavior. When enabled, the code will attempt up to 3 micro-rounds (or until CAP is exhausted), re-evaluating the remaining budget after each round. When disabled, the old single micro-round strategy remains. This targeted change stays within the existing framework and aims to push performance beyond the current 2.30 benchmark by better densifying the tail with controlled, capacity-aware micro-structures.
