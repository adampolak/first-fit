rotating_spine_templates
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Introduce a small bank of four start‐pattern templates and rotate among them each spine round. By breaking the rigid periodicity of the classic (2,6,10,14) pattern, we hope to diversify the overlap structure and force FirstFit into more new colors while keeping the clique number unchanged.
