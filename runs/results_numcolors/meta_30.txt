# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: The function construct_intervals builds a sequence of open intervals starting from T = [(0, 1)], then repeats twice: compute lo, hi, and delta = hi - lo, build S by scaling and translating each interval in T by delta*s for s in (2, 6, 10, 14), then append four fixed delta-scaled blocks (delta*1, delta*5), (delta*12, delta*16), (delta*4, delta*9), (delta*8, delta*13); set T = S and return the final list of 36 intervals. The run_experiment wrapper simply returns construct_intervals(); intervals are represented as open intervals (l, r).
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.70; competitive ratio 2.33; number of intervals 36 (alg: 7; opt: 3).
- **Feedback**: The implementation follows the two-phase, delta-scaled expansion inspired by the referenced figure, yielding a deterministic, reproducible interval sequence that passes validation tests. The presence of a commented Figure-3 alternative indicates explorations of different OPT/FF configurations, suggesting room for further optimization or variant testing.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 0 - Patch Name initial_program - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of open intervals T by starting with (0,1) and, for six iterations, computing delta = current span (hi - lo). It expands T by adding scaled copies of all current intervals (offsets delta*start for start in 2,6,10,14) and then appending four fixed blocks (delta*1 to delta*5, delta*12 to delta*16, delta*4 to delta*9, delta*8 to delta*13). The result is assigned back to T each iteration and returned; run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.90; competitive_ratio 2.71 with 9556 intervals generated.
- **Feedback**: The code faithfully implements the Figure 4 construction from the referenced paper and passes all validations, producing a large, scalable interval set; however, the resulting interval count and numeric magnitude can be substantial, which may impact runtime in larger runs.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 1 - Patch Name deepen_recursive_figure4_to_6 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Kierstead-Trotter Interval Blow-Up Builder**
- **Implementation**: Recursively builds interval blocks starting from T=[(0.0,1.0)], and at each depth expands by four scaled copies placed at offsets [2,6,10,14] times the current span, shifting by base = off*span - lo; then adds four connector intervals to form an FF chain, repeating for the given depth. A run_experiment wrapper calls construct_intervals; there is a second, redundant run_experiment definition present.
- **Performance**: Evaluation reports a competitive ratio of 2.50 with 148 intervals produced (combined score to maximize: 1.00).
- **Feedback**: The implementation yields a self-similar, scalable FF-chain interval sequence through span-based scaling and explicit connectors, though the duplicate run_experiment definition is a minor code quirk that could confuse readers; depth controls growth and numerical scales are floating-point.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 2 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-inspired Block Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: Parameterized recursive construction builds T starting from [(0,1)], and at each depth creates S by placing 2+4*i scaled copies (i in 0..branching-1) of the current T shifted by a base computed from span and lo. It also adds adjacent connectors between blocks and optional cross-block connectors (based on branching) before iterating. The final T after the last depth is returned as a list of open intervals in presentation order.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.00; competitive_ratio: 1.00; num_intervals: 1561.
- **Feedback**: Clear KT-inspired scaling and connector strategy are implemented and validated (default depth=4, branching=5 yield 1561 intervals). However, the approach scales rapidly with depth and branching, and the code lacks optimization or memoization, limiting efficiency for larger parameters.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 3 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Wave-based FirstFit interval generator**
- **Implementation**: The code builds a sequence of open intervals by starting with T = [(0,1)], and iteratively expanding it over a number of rounds. In each round it computes lo, hi, and delta from T, shifts the entire current set by delta * start for a list of starts (expanding in later rounds), appends four local blocks to create overlapping waves, and updates T until completion; the final list T is returned as the interval set.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 1.00; competitive_ratio: 2.50; num_intervals: 548, indicating a large, validated adversarial instance suitable for FirstFit testing.
- **Feedback**: The implementation faithfully realizes the recursive wave construction described in the docstring and yields a sizeable interval set that passes validation tests; the approach is compact and self-contained but could benefit from parameterization and clearer documentation of the local-block rationale and coordinate scaling.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 4 - Patch Name multi_round_wave_expansion - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Wave Construction for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of intervals by iteratively generating dense "wave" blocks over rounds, duplicating and sometimes reversing the current interval set, inserting short bridges between blocks, adding a small four-interval gadget, and appending sparse cap intervals to keep omega small; the process uses delta-scaled transformations and offsets to place blocks, with a final returned interval list.
- **Performance**: Competitive evaluation shows competitive_ratio 1.00 with 353 intervals and an overall score of 0.00 (alg: 11; opt: 11).
- **Feedback**: The approach leverages alternating inner order, bridging, and caps to maximize FirstFit colors while controlling clique size; while it achieves an optimal competitive ratio in tests, the score indicates no measured gain from optimization, suggesting room for parameter tuning and code clarity improvements.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 5 - Patch Name layered_caps_bridged_rounds2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Recursive wave interval construction for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Starts with (0,1) and, for a given number of rounds, expands the current interval set by translating and scaling it with delta = hi - lo, where lo and hi bound the existing intervals. It uses a fixed sequence of shifts (starts = [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16]) to generate translated copies, then appends a small set of local blocks to create overlapping waves, updating the interval list each round; run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals().
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.70; competitive_ratio 1.40; 100 intervals generated in the final set.
- **Feedback**: The design relies on a dense, hard-coded shift pattern to amplify FirstFit color usage via recursive wave expansion, with performance tied to these fixed choices. Evaluation shows the approach achieves the stated metrics and reproducible results, though the heavy reliance on predetermined patterns may limit generalization and adaptability to other configurations.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 6 - Patch Name denser_starts_two_rounds - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction**

- **Implementation**: Builds a hierarchical, wave-like set of intervals by iterating up to 4 rounds, computing a dynamic delta from current interval extents, and assembling blocks with preload blockers, cloned (or reversed) bases, and bridges between adjacent blocks. Each block contributes a mix of short blockers, cloned intervals, and a bridging interval; additional local gadgets, sparse caps, and occasional long sentries are added before updating the working interval set T for the next round. The main entry point run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals() with default rounds.

- **Performance**: Competitive-driven metrics report a competitive_ratio of 1.13 with 2609 intervals generated; algorithm identifier alg: 17 and optimum opt: 15, and a combined performance score of 0.00, with the implementation validated as correct.

- **Feedback**: The implementation employs arrival-order engineering (alternating clone order, preload blockers, bridges) to pressure First-Fit usage while capping growth through a rounds limit and structured layering (preloads, bridges, caps). This yields substantial interval counts but keeps the offline optimum small; the approach passes validation tests, though parameter choices (block starts, preload counts, and cap spacing) could be tuned for different trade-offs between interval count and color usage pressure.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 7 - Patch Name improved_wave_preload - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Recursive Wave Interval Evolver for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: The algorithm starts with T = [(0, 1)] and iteratively expands it for a specified number of rounds. In each round it finds lo, hi, and delta from T, expands T by translating copies of T using a round-specific set of starts (smaller set in round 0, larger set in later rounds), appends several local blocks to create overlapping waves, and then replaces T with the new set; run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals() with the default rounds=2.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.70; competitive_ratio: 1.40; number of intervals: 174; produced intervals show a mix of small and extended blocks crafted to stress FirstFit.
- **Feedback**: The approach is correct and aligns with a known two-round pattern extended to multiple rounds, using deliberate start offsets and local blocks to push color usage while controlling omega; tuning the rounds or start sets could improve the competitive ratio, and the trailing commentary hints minor documentation cleanup opportunities.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 8 - Patch Name adaptive_wave_density_and_caps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: FirstFit adversarial interval blow-up construction**
- **Implementation**: A deterministic, recursive interval generator parameterized by depth=4 and branching=7. Starting from T = [(0,1)], each level scales and offsets copies of the previous block, using delta based on the current range (lo, hi). It builds S by duplicating T at offsets delta*start (for starts = 2,6,10,...), then appends adjacent and cross-block connectors to enforce color propagation constraints, and iterates. The final list T is returned as the interval sequence (open intervals as (l, r)). run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals.
- **Performance**: Generates 6,801 intervals with a competitive ratio of about 1.44 and a combined score around 1.30, illustrating a substantial blow-up designed to stress FirstFit.
- **Feedback**: The implementation uses a clear, parameterizable blow-up strategy that deterministically constructs adversarial inputs for FirstFit. While effective at creating large inputs and a high color-count-to-overlap ratio, the interval count scales aggressively with depth/branching, and the results depend on fixed parameters; the approach is solid but brittle-to-tune for different evaluation settings.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 9 - Patch Name generalized_branching_connectors - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-inspired interval blow-up construction**
- **Implementation**: Recursive construction starts from T0 = [(0, 1)]. Each depth computes the current span and creates four scaled copies at offsets 2, 6, 10, 14 of the span, then inserts ladder connectors between adjacent blocks, adds cross-layer connectors between nonconsecutive blocks, and includes original figure connectors before updating T = S; the final interval list is returned. A run_experiment wrapper invokes construct_intervals with depth defaulting to 4.
- **Performance**: Competitive ratio: 1.00; number of intervals: 851; combined score to maximize: 0.00.
- **Feedback**: The implementation is correct and passes all validation tests; it uses a KT-like recursive blow-up with explicit connectors to maintain structure, resulting in a deterministic, scalable interval sequence whose size grows with depth (851 intervals at depth=4).
**Program Identifier:** Generation 10 - Patch Name interleaved_connectors - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Adaptive Multi-Round Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Builds an initial core interval, then iteratively expands via translated copies of the current set across a round-dependent list of starts. It alternates using the current set and its reverse, inserts bridging intervals between consecutive starts, and appends a fixed four-interval gadget plus three small caps to influence color usage and omega trade-offs. The process relies on a delta computed from the current interval span and scales all coordinates accordingly; the result is a deterministic, seed-based interval list.
- **Performance**: With default parameters (rounds=3, seed_lo=0.0, seed_scale=1.0), the evaluator reports 2866 intervals and a competitive score/ratio of 1.20.
- **Feedback**: The design favors deterministic, seedable expansion with adaptive start sets to control growth and diversify interval placement (via alternating order and bridging). The combination of gadgets and caps aims to push FF usage while keeping omega small, but it yields a sizeable interval count; parameterizing starts, bridging, and gadget placement could help tune performance and scalability for larger round counts.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 11 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Constructor**

- **Implementation**: Starts from a seed of disjoint unit intervals and grows a sequence using a small bank of four-interval templates plus a deterministic, round-dependent start-pattern cycle. Each round deterministically selects a start pattern and a template based on round index, expands copies of the current set T (alternating between T and reversed(T) to reduce reuse), scales all intervals by a delta derived from the current range, appends the scaled template, and adds a few sparse caps near the starts to couple colors without large omega growth. The process iterates for a configurable number of rounds, returning the final interval set.

- **Performance**: Evaluation reports a combined score of 1.00 with a competitive ratio of 1.25, generating 1417 intervals in total.

- **Feedback**: The approach is correct and passes all validation tests; design choices (seed diversification, template bank, and non-self-similar sequencing) appear to support robust FirstFit behavior within the evaluated constraints.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 12 - Patch Name template_cycle_multi_seed_expansion - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Multi-Round Wave Interval Constructor**
- **Implementation**: Seeds with four disjoint unit intervals, then iteratively expands via rounds that select deterministic start patterns and templates, translates copies of the current set with delta-scaling, alternates inner order to hinder color reuse, bridges between consecutive starts, appends scaled templates, and finally adds sparse caps to subtly pressure color usage; the process yields a new interval set for the next round.
- **Performance**: Reported as a combined score of 1.30 (competitive_ratio 1.30) producing 1,631 intervals.
- **Feedback**: The approach uses deterministic templates and cross-round translations to promote overlap and color coupling, yielding dense interval sets; while predictable, the resulting interval count grows substantially, suggesting a trade-off between coupling and scalability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 13 - Patch Name wavecraft_opt - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Wave-Constructive Evolving Block Intervals**
- **Implementation**: Builds a multi-round sequence of real-line intervals by seeding with four disjoint unit blocks, then per round selecting a 4-interval template and a start-pattern to generate scaled copies with bridges, a middle-gadget injection, and two sparse cap families; it alternates block order (original vs reversed) to hinder FirstFit reuse, adds inter-block bridges (including second-next links on some rounds), and uses a middle-block gadget and delta-scaling to control growth. Each round transforms the current block set into a larger S with careful scaling and then sets T = S for the next round.
- **Performance**: Achieves a competitive_ratio of 1.11 with 2380 intervals generated (combined score 0.00 in the provided metrics).
- **Feedback**: The approach yields moderate FirstFit pressure while constraining omega growth through sparse bridging, templated variation, and gadget injections; it uses deterministic round-based patterning to maintain reproducibility and passes validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 14 - Patch Name bridges_microgadgets_and_dual_caps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic 4-branch interval builder with templates**
- **Implementation**: Builds a deterministic sequence of open intervals by iterating a 4-branch growth with 4 connectors per level. Each iteration selects a start pattern, varies block order, toggles clone order (T or reversed(T)) for each block, and appends four connectors from a rotating template bank; the current span scales offsets for clones, then connectors are scaled by the iteration span.
- **Performance**: Fixed depth of 6 yields 9556 intervals with a competitive_ratio of ~1.18 and a reported combined score of 0.00; results are reproducible due to fixed seeds and deterministic ordering.
- **Feedback**: The diversification of arrival order, clone order, and connector templates reduces FirstFit reuse and improves variety while keeping growth predictable; the implementation is correct and passes validation tests, though memory grows rapidly with depth and could be tuned for larger scopes.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 15 - Patch Name cyclic_wave_diversifier - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Multi-Round Wave Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Starts with four unit intervals, then iteratively expands for a number of rounds by selecting a start pattern and a template, translating copies of the current set with deterministic jitter and occasional reversal, and bridging consecutive blocks to encourage color coupling. It appends the chosen template scaled by the round delta, adds sparse caps to pressure color usage, and replaces the working set T each round; optional extra rounds use an extended, fixed scheme before returning T.
- **Performance**: Produces 1748 intervals with a competitive_ratio of 1.06 and a neutral combined score of 0.00, with all behavior being fully deterministic due to the seeded jitter.
- **Feedback**: The deterministic jitter and templated expansion yield reproducible, densely interconnected interval sets aimed at stressing FirstFit-like algorithms; tuning rounds, extra_rounds, and cap strategy can significantly affect density and pressure, suggesting opportunities for parameter refinement to balance coverage and performance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 16 - Patch Name break_self_similarity_with_jitter_and_extra_rounds - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Adaptive Multi-round Interval Waves**
- **Implementation**: Starts from a compact core of four seed intervals and, for a fixed number of rounds, expands by translating and scaling copies of the current interval set relative to its [lo, hi] span; employs alternating base order, bridging between adjacent blocks, and adds gadget/micro-gadget blocks plus small caps to influence interval distribution, returning a list of open-interval endpoints.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.00; competitive_ratio 1.07 with 6302 intervals produced; 15 construction steps across 3 rounds, and validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: The deterministic, adaptive expansion yields near-optimal competitive performance while generating a large but controlled interval set; however, the approach relies on many hard-coded constants (starts, gadget shapes) that hurt readability and tunability, suggesting brittleness for future adjustments.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 17 - Patch Name multi_seed_and_micro_gadget - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Recursive Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: The algorithm builds a spine of four disjoint unit intervals and then performs three rounds of translated copies controlled by start patterns. Each round translates copies (alternating inner order via base = T or reversed(T)), applies a delta scaling (delta = hi−lo, or 1.0 if degenerate), adds light bridges between consecutive starts, injects a fixed 4-interval gadget scaled by delta, and appends sparse caps around interior block indices. The resulting set becomes the new spine for the next round and is finally returned as the open-interval sequence.
- **Performance**: Competitive_ratio is 1.07 with 675 intervals generated; the combined score is reported as 0.00, and the intervals span large scaled ranges, reflecting the multi-round translation and layering strategy.
- **Feedback**: The approach systematically hinders FirstFit reuse by alternating inner order, bridging between blocks, and injecting gadgets while keeping omega small, achieving a solid ratio at the cost of a relatively large interval count. Potential improvements could target reducing interval count or parameterizing rounds/start patterns for efficiency gains.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 18 - Patch Name three_round_spine_bridges_caps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-style interval blow-up (3-depth)**
- **Implementation**: Recursively build an interval sequence starting from [(0.0, 1.0)]. Each depth level computes the current span and creates four scaled copies of the existing blocks at offsets [2, 6, 10, 14] of span, then appends four connector intervals to link the blocks into a single chain; the process repeats for the specified depth. The function returns intervals in presentation order; run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals() with the default depth.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.00; competitive_ratio 2.50; 148 intervals generated.
- **Feedback**: The approach matches the intended Kierstead–Trotter style blow-up and yields a deterministic, correct sequence (validated by tests); depth-3 execution produces the expected 148 intervals, and the implementation is straightforward and reproducible.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 20 - Patch Name preload_rotate_improve_ff - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Two-Phase Evolve-Block Interval Constructor**
- **Implementation**: Builds a deterministic, two-phase interval sequence over a fixed depth, starting from a seed of disjoint unit intervals and iteratively expanding with rotated/reversed block orders, preload blockers, short bridges, clone-ordered copies of the previous set, and template-bank connectors; a set of long sentries is added once to bias color usage, and the current interval set becomes the base for the next iteration.
- **Performance**: Competitive_ratio ≈ 1.09 with 56,088 intervals; overall evaluation score reported as 0.00 and validations fail.
- **Feedback**: The approach uses a structured, multi-phase strategy to stress FirstFit while limiting omega, but validation tests fail, suggesting edge-case or connector-logic issues; the produced data also shows signs of brittleness (e.g., large/coerced coordinates and potential formatting/truncation anomalies).
**Program Identifier:** Generation 19 - Patch Name two_phase_preload_sentries - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Kierstead-Trotter Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Recursively builds a float interval sequence starting from T0 = [(0.0, 1.0)]. At each level, four blocks are placed at offsets [2, 6, 10, 14] of the current span; the block order is alternated by level (reverse on odd levels). Each block inserts a small number of preload blockers inside the block, then appends a clone of the current pattern T (reversed on alternating levels). Bridges between adjacent blocks and four global connector intervals are added, and the result becomes the new T for the next depth iteration.
- **Performance**: Competitive ratio 1.25 with 1531 intervals generated; evaluation shows a Combined score of 0.00.
- **Feedback**: The implementation is correct and passes validation tests; the gadget scaffolding (blockers, bridges, and alternating clone order) yields a varied interval layout and controlled growth, though the interval count grows rapidly with depth.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 21 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolving block gadget intervals for FF coloring**
- **Implementation**: The core is construct_intervals, which builds a sequence of open intervals by iterative rounds. Each round seeds a set T of disjoint unit intervals, then selects a pair of gadget templates and a start-pattern cycle. It clones and translates T into multiple blocks (reversing on alternating blocks), bridges between blocks, appends a scaled gadget template, adds short caps around each start, and finally inserts longer sparse caps to couple distant colors. The result is scaled by delta (based on current T span) and shifted by lo, producing a final list of (l, r) intervals in arrival order.
- **Performance**: The run_experiment path simply calls construct_intervals with default parameters, yielding a reported competitive_ratio of about 1.17 with 1918 intervals (and a zero aggregate score in the provided metrics). The approach is deterministic across rounds due to fixed start_patterns and templates, producing a large, highly structured interval set.
- **Feedback**: The implementation employs multiple gadget templates, deterministic start-pattern cycling, and cross-block coupling (bridges and sparse caps) to influence FirstFit behavior. This yields rich interval interaction and a high interval count, but the evaluation output shows a heavy, float-based interval construction with complex spacing; tuning seed_scale, rounds, and pattern choices could further normalize interval ranges or improve the observed metrics.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 22 - Patch Name recursive_wave_crossover - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic multi-round wave interval builder**
- **Implementation**: Builds multi-round, delta-scaled interval sets using a seed of four unit intervals, a bank of four-interval templates, and three start-pattern sequences. Each round translates or reverses the base intervals, adds light bridging between adjacent blocks, appends a template, and then adds sparse caps before using the result as the new base for the next round. Includes a second, overriding run_experiment definition that ignores kwargs and calls construct_intervals with defaults.
- **Performance**: Evaluated with 3 rounds by default, achieving 1748 intervals and a competitive_ratio of 1.07 (Combined score 0.00); the report notes the program is correct and passes validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The design purposefully preserves a low clique number while coupling colors via bridging and alternating inner orders; delta-scaling and templates aim to increase First-Fit pressure. The presence of an overriding run_experiment that ignores kwargs could cause confusion or unintended usage in some evaluators.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 23 - Patch Name delta_wave_templates_bridges - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of scaled interval blocks across a small number of rounds, using alternating block order (T vs reversed(T)), delta-based scaling, thin bridges between blocks, a fixed four-interval gadget, and an embedded micro-gadget near the median start. The starts list changes between rounds, and sparse caps are added to gently pressure density; the function returns the final interval set after the specified rounds.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.00; competitive_ratio 1.00; num_intervals 302.
- **Feedback**: The deterministic gadget-based construction yields stable, reproducible intervals that respect clique-size constraints while driving color usage; it passes validation tests, though reliance on hard-coded patterns may limit generality to other instance settings.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 24 - Patch Name alternating_bridges_microcaps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hybrid Kierstead–Trotter interval generator**
- **Implementation**: Implements a four-round blow-up style construction starting from (0,1). Each round computes span = hi - lo, builds four scaled blocks with starts [2, 6, 10, 14], adds preload small intervals, appends either cloned or reversed-cloned copies of the previous round, inserts bridges, adjacent and global connectors, sparse caps, and two long sentries in round 0; the newly built set becomes the basis for the next round and the final T is returned.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.00; competitive_ratio 1.22; 2169 intervals generated.
- **Feedback**: The evaluator reports the program is incorrect and fails validation tests; likely issues include ad hoc scaling/assembly leading to invalid interval sets, potential duplicates or degenerate intervals, and lack of guarantees about ordering or constraint satisfaction. Suggested fixes involve validating constraints, deduplicating and sorting results, and tightening arithmetic to avoid edge-case misscalings.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 25 - Patch Name improved_kierstead_trotter - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Deterministic fractal-interval generator (FirstFit)**  
- **Implementation**: Core logic resides in construct_intervals, which seeds four disjoint unit intervals, defines four gadget templates and several deterministic start-pattern cycles, and iteratively expands the interval set over rounds by translating, bridging, and scaling blocks. Each round selects a pattern/template (cycled by roundIdx), clones and reverses blocks, adds inter-block bridges, appends a scaled gadget, injects a micro-gadget, and finally adds sparse cap intervals before updating the working set. The function is exposed via two run_experiment definitions, with the final one delegating to construct_intervals() ignoring incoming kwargs.  
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.00; competitive_ratio: 1.12; num_intervals: 2252; alg: 19; opt: 17.  
- **Feedback**: The approach yields stable, reproducible expansions due to deterministic pattern/template cycling, but relies on heavy, hard-coded constants which limit adaptability. A potential integration pitfall exists from having two run_experiment definitions, where the final one ignores kwargs, which could confuse callers. Overall, the method produces a large, fractal-like interval set consistent with the reported metrics.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 26 - Patch Name fractal_waveff - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Shrink + Spine-Blocker Builder**
- **Implementation**: Builds interval sets through multiple rounds by normalizing the current pattern to [0,1], applying a round-dependent width shrink and increasing block spacing, and placing long spine blockers before scaled normal intervals. Each block uses deterministic jitter, alternates inner order, and employs rotating templates and start patterns to vary alignment; additional light bridges and end caps pressure FirstFit locally, and an optional extra_rounds phase densifies starts with extended_starts and a central template.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.00; competitive_ratio: 1.00; num_intervals: 823.
- **Feedback**: The approach aggressively constrains omega by spacing and spine blockers while using normalization and shrinking to maintain scale stability; deterministic pattern rotation plus jitter improves reproducibility without full randomness, though added rounds increase complexity. Overall, it passes validation with the reported metrics.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 27 - Patch Name hierarchical_shrink_spine_blocks - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Iteratively build a sequence of open intervals by starting with (0,1) and repeating a fixed-depth, fixed-branching block construction. At each level, scale and translate copies of the current interval set T, reverse alternating blocks, and append adjacent and cross-connecting intervals to propagate colors while avoiding clique increases. The process uses parameters depth=4 and branching=7 and returns the final interval list T, with run_experiment exposing construct_intervals().
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.30; competitive_ratio 1.44; num_intervals 6801 generated (example output includes a large list of intervals).
- **Feedback**: The approach yields a deterministic, large-scale interval construction that passes validation tests and demonstrates strong blow-up behavior suitable for analyzing FirstFit performance. The implementation tightly couples scaling, offsets, and connectors to control color propagation without increasing cliques, though the resulting interval list is extensive and sensitive to the chosen depth/branching parameters.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 28 - Patch Name alternating_block_order - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Builder for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of translated and interwoven interval blocks across multiple rounds. It seeds with disjoint unit intervals, uses predefined template banks and start-patterns, applies bridges between blocks, adds micro-caps and sparse long caps, and scales all content by a round-specific delta to produce a recursive, wave-like construction.
- **Performance**: Competitive ratio ≈ 1.16 with 2365 intervals produced; combined score reported as 0.00.
- **Feedback**: The implementation employs a dense coupling strategy (bridges, micro-caps, long caps, and tower caps) to pressure FirstFit into using more colors while keeping omega controlled; it is self-contained and validated, though readability and parameter tuning could be improved for easier adaptation and analysis.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 30 - Patch Name bridged_wave_templates_v3 - Correct Program: True

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Below is a focused analysis of the concrete evaluation results, tying the current best pattern to other evaluated variants and highlighting what patterns tend to correlate with stronger vs weaker performance.

Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Delta-based self-similar expansion with a fixed translational scaffold
  - Current best: EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
    - Core mechanic: starting from T = [(0,1)], perform six iterations. In each iteration, compute lo, hi, delta = hi − lo, then translate copies of the current T by delta * start for starts in (2, 6, 10, 14) to form S. Append four fixed delta-scaled blocks: (delta*1, delta*5), (delta*12, delta*16), (delta*4, delta*9), (delta*8, delta*13). Set T = S for the next round.
    - Outcome: 9556 intervals, combined score 1.90, competitive_ratio 2.71.
    - Takeaway: The disciplined, self-similar, delta-driven growth that combines both translated blocks and fixed delta-scaled blocks yields the strongest FF-pressure signal among the evaluated variants, even at the cost of large interval counts.
- Deterministic multi-round expansion with bridging, templates, and round-based detuning
  - Examples: Generation 13 (Deterministic Multi-Round Wave Interval Constructor)
    - Pattern: deterministic rounds, delta-based translations, alternating inner order, bridging between starts, with scaled templates/gadgets appended.
    - Outcome: 1631 intervals, combined score 1.30.
  - Example: Generation 28 (Evolve-Block Interval Construction for FirstFit)
    - Pattern: expanded delta-style growth with translated blocks plus additional blocks and gadgets; results in 6801 intervals and combined score about 1.30.
    - Takeaway: Deterministic, round-based expansion with strategic bridging and template/gadget augmentation can yield solid FF-pressure with more moderate interval counts than the best delta-only blow-up.
- Alternating base order and bridging to impede color reuse
  - Examples: Generation 16 and related variants emphasize alternating block order to disrupt simple color reuse, sometimes achieving respectable ratio scores with moderate counts.
  - Takeaway: Alternating inner order helps diversify interval interaction and contributes to FirstFit pressure when coupled with other constructive elements (bridges, templates).

Ineffective Approaches
- Overly large, noisy expansions with little or negative FF-pressure benefit
  - Example: EVOLVE-BLOCK-START’s close cousins that balloon intervals excessively without commensurate score (e.g., Two-Phase Evolve-Block Interval Constructor with 56k intervals; validations fail; combined score 0.00).
  - Gen 19 highlighted brittleness: very large coordinates, potential formatting/truncation issues, and validation failures despite a big interval count.
  - Gen 26 (Deterministic fractal-interval generator) produced 2252 intervals with ratio 1.12 but combined score 0.00, indicating that heavy deterministic fractals without well-aligned connectors/gadgets often fail to translate into FF-pressure gains.
- Ad hoc scaling or misaligned assembly leading to invalid or non-beneficial sets
  - Hybrid Kierstead–Trotter (Generation 25) is labeled incorrect and fails validation; likely due to inconsistent scaling or deduplication gaps, yielding invalid interval sets despite a reasonable interval count.
  - Gen 21 (Kierstead–Trotter Interval Builder) produced 1531 intervals with ratio 1.25 but combined score 0.00; despite a clean implementation, the overall pressure on FirstFit wasn’t achieved.
- Gadget-heavy or deeply nested patterns without proper integration
  - Examples: Generation 22 and Generation 30 variants emphasize gadgets, micro-gadgets, long caps, and bridges but often yield zero combined score, suggesting that gadgets alone are not sufficient; they must be tightly integrated with the underlying delta/translation expansion to improve FF-pressure.
- Very small or unevenly scaled patterns that underperform
  - Several small-pattern variants (e.g., Gen 23 with 1748 intervals at ratio 1.07; Gen 27 with 823 intervals at ratio 1.00) fail to achieve nonzero combined scores, underscoring that moderate growth without well-tuned inter-block interactions is insufficient.

Implementation Insights
- What makes the current best effective
  - Simple, deterministic, multi-round delta-expansion
    - The six-round loop with a consistent delta-based translation strategy (offsets 2, 6, 10, 14) plus four fixed delta-scaled blocks creates a dense but structured interaction among intervals that robustly increases color usage under FirstFit.
    - Deterministic sequencing (no randomness) aids reproducibility and consistent pressure across evaluators, which aligns with the validation-driven environment.
  - Dual-scale construction within each round
    - The combination of translated copies (local clustering) and appended delta-scaled blocks (long-range interactions) ensures both local and global coupling, which appears to enhance the evaluator’s pressure without relying solely on gadgetry.
  - Predictable growth with bounded incremental complexity
    - Although the final interval count is large (9556), the growth follows a clear, repeatable rule set, enabling stronger scoring signals than ad hoc or excessively complex patterns that fail validation.
- How this relates to other patterns
  - Similar delta-driven, self-similar growth patterns (Gen 13 and Gen 28) achieve solid scores with far fewer intervals, indicating that the core mechanism is effective but the score benefits scale with how aggressively the delta-based growth is executed and how well bridging/connectors are integrated.
  - When bridging, gadgets, and extra scaffolding are not tightly coupled to a coherent delta-expansion strategy, the results tend to underperform (e.g., Gen 19, Gen 21, Gen 22, Gen 26, Gen 27, Gen 30), reinforcing that alignment between growth mechanics and connector/gadget design is critical.

Performance Analysis
- Comparative metrics across representative programs
  - EVOLVE-BLOCK-START (current best)
    - Intervals: 9556
    - Combined score: 1.90
    - Competitive ratio: 2.71
    - Implication: Strong FF-pressure signal at the cost of very large interval sets; high score indicates effective alignment with the evaluation objective.
  - Deterministic Multi-Round Wave Interval Constructor (Gen 13)
    - Intervals: 1631
    - Combined score: 1.30
    - Ratio: 1.30
    - Implication: Demonstrates that deterministic, round-based growth can yield solid pressure with substantially fewer intervals than the best, indicating more efficient patterns exist when delta-expansion is tuned.
  - Evolve-Block Interval Construction for FirstFit (Gen 28)
    - Intervals: 6801
    - Combined score: about 1.30
    - Ratio: about 1.44
    - Implication: Closer in performance to the best than some low-count patterns but still below EVOLVE-BLOCK-START; shows that delta-expansion with additional structural elements can scale up FF-pressure without exploding interval counts as much as the best.
  - KT-style interval blow-up (Gen 21)
    - Intervals: 1531
    - Ratio: 1.25
    - Combined score: 0.00
    - Implication: High ratio alone does not guarantee positive pressure; misalignment with the scoring objective reduces usefulness.
  - Very large/noisy patterns (Gen 19) and gadget-heavy misaligned patterns (Gen 22, Gen 30)
    - Intervals range widely (tens of thousands in Gen 19), but combined scores are 0.00, indicating that sheer scale without coherent design to pressure FirstFit is ineffective.
  - Deterministic fractal/grow-with-templates (Gen 26)
    - Intervals: 2252
    - Ratio: 1.12
    - Combined score: 0.00
    - Implication: Fractal-like growth without carefully tuned connectors/gadgets tends not to translate into FF-pressure in this evaluation framework.
- Trends and correlations
  - Patterns that combine delta-driven self-similar expansion with a compact, interpretable expansion rule tend to produce higher combined scores (EVOLVE-BLOCK-START, Gen 13, Gen 28), especially when the translation offsets and appended blocks are chosen to create both local clustering and long-range interaction.
  - Simply increasing interval counts (Gen 19) or relying on gadgets without coherent alignment (Gen 22, Gen 30) tends to yield low or zero combined scores, highlighting that quality of pressure (pattern alignment) matters more than raw quantity.
  - Deterministic, reproducible designs outperform ad hoc or highly noisy constructions in achieving positive combined scores, reinforcing the value of clarity and repeatability in these evaluations.

In summary, the current best program, EVOLVE-BLOCK-START, demonstrates that a disciplined, delta-based, self-similar expansion with translated copies and fixed delta-scaled blocks across multiple rounds delivers the strongest FirstFit pressure signal among the evaluated variants, albeit at the cost of a large interval count. Other patterns show that similar delta-expansion ideas can be effective with more moderate counts (Gen 13, Gen 28), while several other approaches fail to translate structural design into positive scoring (Gen 21, Gen 19, Gen 26, Gen 27, Gen 30, Gen 22). The key takeaway is that the effectiveness hinges on coherent integration of the delta-expansion mechanics with well-aligned connectors and pattern scaffolding, as exemplified by the current best.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1) Introduce a deterministic rotation of the translation-start pattern across rounds
- Implement a cycle for the starts in the translated copies: use (2,6,10,14) for round 0, then (1,5,9,13) for round 1, (3,7,11,15) for round 2, and (2,4,8,12) for round 3, repeating every four rounds. This preserves the delta-driven growth but disrupts a single repeating overlap pattern, potentially increasing color pressure without sacrificing determinism.
- Why this matters: The current best relies on fixed starts for tight self-similarity; rotating the starts can reduce predictable color reuse and broaden interaction density, based on the observed value of alternating inner patterns.

2) Add a deterministic, rotating template bank for the four delta-scaled blocks
- Create a small bank of four templates for the delta-scaled blocks (A, B, C, D). Each template defines a distinct set of four blocks, e.g., A = [(delta,5delta), (12delta,16delta), (4delta,9delta), (8delta,13delta)] (the original), B = [(2delta,6delta), (11delta,15delta), (3delta,7delta), (9delta,13delta)], C = [(0,4delta), (10delta,14delta), (5delta,9delta), (7delta,12delta)], D = [(delta,4delta), (9delta,13delta), (6delta,10delta), (8delta,12delta)]. Apply one of these templates per iteration in a deterministic cycle.
- Why: The current best gains come from the fixed four-block pattern; rotating among templates preserves delta-expansion benefits while altering long-range interactions, which can boost FF-pressure without inflating counts unpredictably.

3) Implement a two-phase delta expansion with a smaller-scale second phase
- After completing the initial six iterations, perform a second phase with delta2 = max(1, floor(delta/2)) starting from an appropriate seed (e.g., start set (1,3,5,7)) using the same template bank in a deterministic cycle. Run 2–3 additional iterations in this phase and then continue with the main cycle if needed.
- Why: Deterministic, multi-scale growth has shown strong pressure signals; a smaller-scale second phase can introduce new interaction patterns and bridging opportunities that are not visible at the original scale, often with modestly increased efficiency.

4) Seed the initial T with multiple small, disjoint unit intervals
- Initialize T as a small, richer seed, for example T = [(0,1), (2,3), (4,5), (6,7)]. Keep the first unit if comparability is desired, but include additional seeds to foster early inter-block interactions.
- Why: A denser, non-overlapping seed set expands the space for translated copies to interact early, increasing the chance of diverse color usage and stronger FF-pressure while remaining fully deterministic.

5) Extend the iteration depth to eight rounds with optional inner-order alternation
- Expand the main delta-expansion loop from 6 to 8 iterations, keeping the same structure (translation + four delta-scaled blocks) and deterministic templates. Optionally alternate the inner order of T (e.g., reverse(T) every two rounds) to further disrupt naive color reuse while preserving determinism.
- Why: The strongest patterns combine disciplined delta growth with deeper expansion. Two extra rounds amplify local/global interactions and can boost the FF-pressure signal without resorting to ad hoc gadgetry or uncontrolled scaling.

These recommendations build directly on the current best’s core mechanism (delta-based self-similar expansion with translated copies and fixed delta-blocks) while adding deterministic variability, multi-scale growth, and richer seeding to explore more effective interaction patterns without abandoning reproducibility.
