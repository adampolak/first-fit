rotate_interleave_plus_four_window_micro
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
I propose two targeted changes inspired by KT-style constructions and windowed micro-phases shown to push FirstFit without increasing omega.

1) Rotate the four KT start templates across rounds and interleave blocks on even rounds.
- Prior best performers used rotating starts and periodic interleaving, which couples colors across scales better than a fixed start with purely sequential concatenation. This is known to raise FirstFit while keeping the clique bounded by the same connector pattern.
- I keep the classic four connectors to preserve omega ≈ 10.

2) Add a CAP‑guarded, deterministic four-window micro-phase after the existing micro rounds.
- This micro-phase uses a thin, evenly spaced seed and translates it into four interior windows at distinct span fractions, with a small set of fractional-span connectors. The windows are chosen to avoid stack-up near the ends and to keep local cliques modest while increasing FF pressure through arrival-order engineering and cross-window coupling.
- The budget is bounded so the total count remains below CAP.

These edits aim to move the ratio from 2.20 back toward the stronger 2.30 range observed in earlier variants, while keeping the program structure and safety guards intact.
