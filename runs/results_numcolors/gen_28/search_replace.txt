alternating_block_order
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Introduce a deterministic alternation of the internal block order within each expansion depth. Specifically, reverse the order of the scaled copies of the previous interval set for every other block. This changes the sequence in which FirstFit sees overlapping intervals, making color reuse harder and potentially increasing the number of colors FF uses without changing the clique size. The change is fully deterministic (no randomness) and preserves the total number of intervals while altering their presentation order to FF.
