<NAME>enable_parabolic_default_on</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Make parabolic micro-phase a default enhancement by turning on the enable_parabolic flag by default.
This leverages the existing lightweight parabolic micro-phase to boost FirstFit pressure with controlled omega growth, improving the combined score without rewriting core logic.
