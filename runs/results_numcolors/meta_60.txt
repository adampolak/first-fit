# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: The function construct_intervals builds a sequence of open intervals starting from T = [(0, 1)], then repeats twice: compute lo, hi, and delta = hi - lo, build S by scaling and translating each interval in T by delta*s for s in (2, 6, 10, 14), then append four fixed delta-scaled blocks (delta*1, delta*5), (delta*12, delta*16), (delta*4, delta*9), (delta*8, delta*13); set T = S and return the final list of 36 intervals. The run_experiment wrapper simply returns construct_intervals(); intervals are represented as open intervals (l, r).
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.70; competitive ratio 2.33; number of intervals 36 (alg: 7; opt: 3).
- **Feedback**: The implementation follows the two-phase, delta-scaled expansion inspired by the referenced figure, yielding a deterministic, reproducible interval sequence that passes validation tests. The presence of a commented Figure-3 alternative indicates explorations of different OPT/FF configurations, suggesting room for further optimization or variant testing.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 0 - Patch Name initial_program - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of open intervals T by starting with (0,1) and, for six iterations, computing delta = current span (hi - lo). It expands T by adding scaled copies of all current intervals (offsets delta*start for start in 2,6,10,14) and then appending four fixed blocks (delta*1 to delta*5, delta*12 to delta*16, delta*4 to delta*9, delta*8 to delta*13). The result is assigned back to T each iteration and returned; run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.90; competitive_ratio 2.71 with 9556 intervals generated.
- **Feedback**: The code faithfully implements the Figure 4 construction from the referenced paper and passes all validations, producing a large, scalable interval set; however, the resulting interval count and numeric magnitude can be substantial, which may impact runtime in larger runs.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 1 - Patch Name deepen_recursive_figure4_to_6 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Kierstead-Trotter Interval Blow-Up Builder**
- **Implementation**: Recursively builds interval blocks starting from T=[(0.0,1.0)], and at each depth expands by four scaled copies placed at offsets [2,6,10,14] times the current span, shifting by base = off*span - lo; then adds four connector intervals to form an FF chain, repeating for the given depth. A run_experiment wrapper calls construct_intervals; there is a second, redundant run_experiment definition present.
- **Performance**: Evaluation reports a competitive ratio of 2.50 with 148 intervals produced (combined score to maximize: 1.00).
- **Feedback**: The implementation yields a self-similar, scalable FF-chain interval sequence through span-based scaling and explicit connectors, though the duplicate run_experiment definition is a minor code quirk that could confuse readers; depth controls growth and numerical scales are floating-point.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 2 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-inspired Block Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: Parameterized recursive construction builds T starting from [(0,1)], and at each depth creates S by placing 2+4*i scaled copies (i in 0..branching-1) of the current T shifted by a base computed from span and lo. It also adds adjacent connectors between blocks and optional cross-block connectors (based on branching) before iterating. The final T after the last depth is returned as a list of open intervals in presentation order.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.00; competitive_ratio: 1.00; num_intervals: 1561.
- **Feedback**: Clear KT-inspired scaling and connector strategy are implemented and validated (default depth=4, branching=5 yield 1561 intervals). However, the approach scales rapidly with depth and branching, and the code lacks optimization or memoization, limiting efficiency for larger parameters.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 3 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Wave-based FirstFit interval generator**
- **Implementation**: The code builds a sequence of open intervals by starting with T = [(0,1)], and iteratively expanding it over a number of rounds. In each round it computes lo, hi, and delta from T, shifts the entire current set by delta * start for a list of starts (expanding in later rounds), appends four local blocks to create overlapping waves, and updates T until completion; the final list T is returned as the interval set.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 1.00; competitive_ratio: 2.50; num_intervals: 548, indicating a large, validated adversarial instance suitable for FirstFit testing.
- **Feedback**: The implementation faithfully realizes the recursive wave construction described in the docstring and yields a sizeable interval set that passes validation tests; the approach is compact and self-contained but could benefit from parameterization and clearer documentation of the local-block rationale and coordinate scaling.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 4 - Patch Name multi_round_wave_expansion - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Wave Construction for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of intervals by iteratively generating dense "wave" blocks over rounds, duplicating and sometimes reversing the current interval set, inserting short bridges between blocks, adding a small four-interval gadget, and appending sparse cap intervals to keep omega small; the process uses delta-scaled transformations and offsets to place blocks, with a final returned interval list.
- **Performance**: Competitive evaluation shows competitive_ratio 1.00 with 353 intervals and an overall score of 0.00 (alg: 11; opt: 11).
- **Feedback**: The approach leverages alternating inner order, bridging, and caps to maximize FirstFit colors while controlling clique size; while it achieves an optimal competitive ratio in tests, the score indicates no measured gain from optimization, suggesting room for parameter tuning and code clarity improvements.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 5 - Patch Name layered_caps_bridged_rounds2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Recursive wave interval construction for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Starts with (0,1) and, for a given number of rounds, expands the current interval set by translating and scaling it with delta = hi - lo, where lo and hi bound the existing intervals. It uses a fixed sequence of shifts (starts = [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16]) to generate translated copies, then appends a small set of local blocks to create overlapping waves, updating the interval list each round; run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals().
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.70; competitive_ratio 1.40; 100 intervals generated in the final set.
- **Feedback**: The design relies on a dense, hard-coded shift pattern to amplify FirstFit color usage via recursive wave expansion, with performance tied to these fixed choices. Evaluation shows the approach achieves the stated metrics and reproducible results, though the heavy reliance on predetermined patterns may limit generalization and adaptability to other configurations.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 6 - Patch Name denser_starts_two_rounds - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction**

- **Implementation**: Builds a hierarchical, wave-like set of intervals by iterating up to 4 rounds, computing a dynamic delta from current interval extents, and assembling blocks with preload blockers, cloned (or reversed) bases, and bridges between adjacent blocks. Each block contributes a mix of short blockers, cloned intervals, and a bridging interval; additional local gadgets, sparse caps, and occasional long sentries are added before updating the working interval set T for the next round. The main entry point run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals() with default rounds.

- **Performance**: Competitive-driven metrics report a competitive_ratio of 1.13 with 2609 intervals generated; algorithm identifier alg: 17 and optimum opt: 15, and a combined performance score of 0.00, with the implementation validated as correct.

- **Feedback**: The implementation employs arrival-order engineering (alternating clone order, preload blockers, bridges) to pressure First-Fit usage while capping growth through a rounds limit and structured layering (preloads, bridges, caps). This yields substantial interval counts but keeps the offline optimum small; the approach passes validation tests, though parameter choices (block starts, preload counts, and cap spacing) could be tuned for different trade-offs between interval count and color usage pressure.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 7 - Patch Name improved_wave_preload - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Recursive Wave Interval Evolver for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: The algorithm starts with T = [(0, 1)] and iteratively expands it for a specified number of rounds. In each round it finds lo, hi, and delta from T, expands T by translating copies of T using a round-specific set of starts (smaller set in round 0, larger set in later rounds), appends several local blocks to create overlapping waves, and then replaces T with the new set; run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals() with the default rounds=2.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.70; competitive_ratio: 1.40; number of intervals: 174; produced intervals show a mix of small and extended blocks crafted to stress FirstFit.
- **Feedback**: The approach is correct and aligns with a known two-round pattern extended to multiple rounds, using deliberate start offsets and local blocks to push color usage while controlling omega; tuning the rounds or start sets could improve the competitive ratio, and the trailing commentary hints minor documentation cleanup opportunities.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 8 - Patch Name adaptive_wave_density_and_caps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: FirstFit adversarial interval blow-up construction**
- **Implementation**: A deterministic, recursive interval generator parameterized by depth=4 and branching=7. Starting from T = [(0,1)], each level scales and offsets copies of the previous block, using delta based on the current range (lo, hi). It builds S by duplicating T at offsets delta*start (for starts = 2,6,10,...), then appends adjacent and cross-block connectors to enforce color propagation constraints, and iterates. The final list T is returned as the interval sequence (open intervals as (l, r)). run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals.
- **Performance**: Generates 6,801 intervals with a competitive ratio of about 1.44 and a combined score around 1.30, illustrating a substantial blow-up designed to stress FirstFit.
- **Feedback**: The implementation uses a clear, parameterizable blow-up strategy that deterministically constructs adversarial inputs for FirstFit. While effective at creating large inputs and a high color-count-to-overlap ratio, the interval count scales aggressively with depth/branching, and the results depend on fixed parameters; the approach is solid but brittle-to-tune for different evaluation settings.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 9 - Patch Name generalized_branching_connectors - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-inspired interval blow-up construction**
- **Implementation**: Recursive construction starts from T0 = [(0, 1)]. Each depth computes the current span and creates four scaled copies at offsets 2, 6, 10, 14 of the span, then inserts ladder connectors between adjacent blocks, adds cross-layer connectors between nonconsecutive blocks, and includes original figure connectors before updating T = S; the final interval list is returned. A run_experiment wrapper invokes construct_intervals with depth defaulting to 4.
- **Performance**: Competitive ratio: 1.00; number of intervals: 851; combined score to maximize: 0.00.
- **Feedback**: The implementation is correct and passes all validation tests; it uses a KT-like recursive blow-up with explicit connectors to maintain structure, resulting in a deterministic, scalable interval sequence whose size grows with depth (851 intervals at depth=4).
**Program Identifier:** Generation 10 - Patch Name interleaved_connectors - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Adaptive Multi-Round Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Builds an initial core interval, then iteratively expands via translated copies of the current set across a round-dependent list of starts. It alternates using the current set and its reverse, inserts bridging intervals between consecutive starts, and appends a fixed four-interval gadget plus three small caps to influence color usage and omega trade-offs. The process relies on a delta computed from the current interval span and scales all coordinates accordingly; the result is a deterministic, seed-based interval list.
- **Performance**: With default parameters (rounds=3, seed_lo=0.0, seed_scale=1.0), the evaluator reports 2866 intervals and a competitive score/ratio of 1.20.
- **Feedback**: The design favors deterministic, seedable expansion with adaptive start sets to control growth and diversify interval placement (via alternating order and bridging). The combination of gadgets and caps aims to push FF usage while keeping omega small, but it yields a sizeable interval count; parameterizing starts, bridging, and gadget placement could help tune performance and scalability for larger round counts.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 11 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Constructor**

- **Implementation**: Starts from a seed of disjoint unit intervals and grows a sequence using a small bank of four-interval templates plus a deterministic, round-dependent start-pattern cycle. Each round deterministically selects a start pattern and a template based on round index, expands copies of the current set T (alternating between T and reversed(T) to reduce reuse), scales all intervals by a delta derived from the current range, appends the scaled template, and adds a few sparse caps near the starts to couple colors without large omega growth. The process iterates for a configurable number of rounds, returning the final interval set.

- **Performance**: Evaluation reports a combined score of 1.00 with a competitive ratio of 1.25, generating 1417 intervals in total.

- **Feedback**: The approach is correct and passes all validation tests; design choices (seed diversification, template bank, and non-self-similar sequencing) appear to support robust FirstFit behavior within the evaluated constraints.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 12 - Patch Name template_cycle_multi_seed_expansion - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Multi-Round Wave Interval Constructor**
- **Implementation**: Seeds with four disjoint unit intervals, then iteratively expands via rounds that select deterministic start patterns and templates, translates copies of the current set with delta-scaling, alternates inner order to hinder color reuse, bridges between consecutive starts, appends scaled templates, and finally adds sparse caps to subtly pressure color usage; the process yields a new interval set for the next round.
- **Performance**: Reported as a combined score of 1.30 (competitive_ratio 1.30) producing 1,631 intervals.
- **Feedback**: The approach uses deterministic templates and cross-round translations to promote overlap and color coupling, yielding dense interval sets; while predictable, the resulting interval count grows substantially, suggesting a trade-off between coupling and scalability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 13 - Patch Name wavecraft_opt - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Wave-Constructive Evolving Block Intervals**
- **Implementation**: Builds a multi-round sequence of real-line intervals by seeding with four disjoint unit blocks, then per round selecting a 4-interval template and a start-pattern to generate scaled copies with bridges, a middle-gadget injection, and two sparse cap families; it alternates block order (original vs reversed) to hinder FirstFit reuse, adds inter-block bridges (including second-next links on some rounds), and uses a middle-block gadget and delta-scaling to control growth. Each round transforms the current block set into a larger S with careful scaling and then sets T = S for the next round.
- **Performance**: Achieves a competitive_ratio of 1.11 with 2380 intervals generated (combined score 0.00 in the provided metrics).
- **Feedback**: The approach yields moderate FirstFit pressure while constraining omega growth through sparse bridging, templated variation, and gadget injections; it uses deterministic round-based patterning to maintain reproducibility and passes validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 14 - Patch Name bridges_microgadgets_and_dual_caps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic 4-branch interval builder with templates**
- **Implementation**: Builds a deterministic sequence of open intervals by iterating a 4-branch growth with 4 connectors per level. Each iteration selects a start pattern, varies block order, toggles clone order (T or reversed(T)) for each block, and appends four connectors from a rotating template bank; the current span scales offsets for clones, then connectors are scaled by the iteration span.
- **Performance**: Fixed depth of 6 yields 9556 intervals with a competitive_ratio of ~1.18 and a reported combined score of 0.00; results are reproducible due to fixed seeds and deterministic ordering.
- **Feedback**: The diversification of arrival order, clone order, and connector templates reduces FirstFit reuse and improves variety while keeping growth predictable; the implementation is correct and passes validation tests, though memory grows rapidly with depth and could be tuned for larger scopes.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 15 - Patch Name cyclic_wave_diversifier - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Multi-Round Wave Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Starts with four unit intervals, then iteratively expands for a number of rounds by selecting a start pattern and a template, translating copies of the current set with deterministic jitter and occasional reversal, and bridging consecutive blocks to encourage color coupling. It appends the chosen template scaled by the round delta, adds sparse caps to pressure color usage, and replaces the working set T each round; optional extra rounds use an extended, fixed scheme before returning T.
- **Performance**: Produces 1748 intervals with a competitive_ratio of 1.06 and a neutral combined score of 0.00, with all behavior being fully deterministic due to the seeded jitter.
- **Feedback**: The deterministic jitter and templated expansion yield reproducible, densely interconnected interval sets aimed at stressing FirstFit-like algorithms; tuning rounds, extra_rounds, and cap strategy can significantly affect density and pressure, suggesting opportunities for parameter refinement to balance coverage and performance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 16 - Patch Name break_self_similarity_with_jitter_and_extra_rounds - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Adaptive Multi-round Interval Waves**
- **Implementation**: Starts from a compact core of four seed intervals and, for a fixed number of rounds, expands by translating and scaling copies of the current interval set relative to its [lo, hi] span; employs alternating base order, bridging between adjacent blocks, and adds gadget/micro-gadget blocks plus small caps to influence interval distribution, returning a list of open-interval endpoints.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.00; competitive_ratio 1.07 with 6302 intervals produced; 15 construction steps across 3 rounds, and validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: The deterministic, adaptive expansion yields near-optimal competitive performance while generating a large but controlled interval set; however, the approach relies on many hard-coded constants (starts, gadget shapes) that hurt readability and tunability, suggesting brittleness for future adjustments.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 17 - Patch Name multi_seed_and_micro_gadget - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Recursive Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: The algorithm builds a spine of four disjoint unit intervals and then performs three rounds of translated copies controlled by start patterns. Each round translates copies (alternating inner order via base = T or reversed(T)), applies a delta scaling (delta = hi−lo, or 1.0 if degenerate), adds light bridges between consecutive starts, injects a fixed 4-interval gadget scaled by delta, and appends sparse caps around interior block indices. The resulting set becomes the new spine for the next round and is finally returned as the open-interval sequence.
- **Performance**: Competitive_ratio is 1.07 with 675 intervals generated; the combined score is reported as 0.00, and the intervals span large scaled ranges, reflecting the multi-round translation and layering strategy.
- **Feedback**: The approach systematically hinders FirstFit reuse by alternating inner order, bridging between blocks, and injecting gadgets while keeping omega small, achieving a solid ratio at the cost of a relatively large interval count. Potential improvements could target reducing interval count or parameterizing rounds/start patterns for efficiency gains.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 18 - Patch Name three_round_spine_bridges_caps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-style interval blow-up (3-depth)**
- **Implementation**: Recursively build an interval sequence starting from [(0.0, 1.0)]. Each depth level computes the current span and creates four scaled copies of the existing blocks at offsets [2, 6, 10, 14] of span, then appends four connector intervals to link the blocks into a single chain; the process repeats for the specified depth. The function returns intervals in presentation order; run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals() with the default depth.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.00; competitive_ratio 2.50; 148 intervals generated.
- **Feedback**: The approach matches the intended Kierstead–Trotter style blow-up and yields a deterministic, correct sequence (validated by tests); depth-3 execution produces the expected 148 intervals, and the implementation is straightforward and reproducible.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 20 - Patch Name preload_rotate_improve_ff - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Two-Phase Evolve-Block Interval Constructor**
- **Implementation**: Builds a deterministic, two-phase interval sequence over a fixed depth, starting from a seed of disjoint unit intervals and iteratively expanding with rotated/reversed block orders, preload blockers, short bridges, clone-ordered copies of the previous set, and template-bank connectors; a set of long sentries is added once to bias color usage, and the current interval set becomes the base for the next iteration.
- **Performance**: Competitive_ratio ≈ 1.09 with 56,088 intervals; overall evaluation score reported as 0.00 and validations fail.
- **Feedback**: The approach uses a structured, multi-phase strategy to stress FirstFit while limiting omega, but validation tests fail, suggesting edge-case or connector-logic issues; the produced data also shows signs of brittleness (e.g., large/coerced coordinates and potential formatting/truncation anomalies).
**Program Identifier:** Generation 19 - Patch Name two_phase_preload_sentries - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Kierstead-Trotter Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Recursively builds a float interval sequence starting from T0 = [(0.0, 1.0)]. At each level, four blocks are placed at offsets [2, 6, 10, 14] of the current span; the block order is alternated by level (reverse on odd levels). Each block inserts a small number of preload blockers inside the block, then appends a clone of the current pattern T (reversed on alternating levels). Bridges between adjacent blocks and four global connector intervals are added, and the result becomes the new T for the next depth iteration.
- **Performance**: Competitive ratio 1.25 with 1531 intervals generated; evaluation shows a Combined score of 0.00.
- **Feedback**: The implementation is correct and passes validation tests; the gadget scaffolding (blockers, bridges, and alternating clone order) yields a varied interval layout and controlled growth, though the interval count grows rapidly with depth.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 21 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolving block gadget intervals for FF coloring**
- **Implementation**: The core is construct_intervals, which builds a sequence of open intervals by iterative rounds. Each round seeds a set T of disjoint unit intervals, then selects a pair of gadget templates and a start-pattern cycle. It clones and translates T into multiple blocks (reversing on alternating blocks), bridges between blocks, appends a scaled gadget template, adds short caps around each start, and finally inserts longer sparse caps to couple distant colors. The result is scaled by delta (based on current T span) and shifted by lo, producing a final list of (l, r) intervals in arrival order.
- **Performance**: The run_experiment path simply calls construct_intervals with default parameters, yielding a reported competitive_ratio of about 1.17 with 1918 intervals (and a zero aggregate score in the provided metrics). The approach is deterministic across rounds due to fixed start_patterns and templates, producing a large, highly structured interval set.
- **Feedback**: The implementation employs multiple gadget templates, deterministic start-pattern cycling, and cross-block coupling (bridges and sparse caps) to influence FirstFit behavior. This yields rich interval interaction and a high interval count, but the evaluation output shows a heavy, float-based interval construction with complex spacing; tuning seed_scale, rounds, and pattern choices could further normalize interval ranges or improve the observed metrics.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 22 - Patch Name recursive_wave_crossover - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic multi-round wave interval builder**
- **Implementation**: Builds multi-round, delta-scaled interval sets using a seed of four unit intervals, a bank of four-interval templates, and three start-pattern sequences. Each round translates or reverses the base intervals, adds light bridging between adjacent blocks, appends a template, and then adds sparse caps before using the result as the new base for the next round. Includes a second, overriding run_experiment definition that ignores kwargs and calls construct_intervals with defaults.
- **Performance**: Evaluated with 3 rounds by default, achieving 1748 intervals and a competitive_ratio of 1.07 (Combined score 0.00); the report notes the program is correct and passes validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The design purposefully preserves a low clique number while coupling colors via bridging and alternating inner orders; delta-scaling and templates aim to increase First-Fit pressure. The presence of an overriding run_experiment that ignores kwargs could cause confusion or unintended usage in some evaluators.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 23 - Patch Name delta_wave_templates_bridges - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of scaled interval blocks across a small number of rounds, using alternating block order (T vs reversed(T)), delta-based scaling, thin bridges between blocks, a fixed four-interval gadget, and an embedded micro-gadget near the median start. The starts list changes between rounds, and sparse caps are added to gently pressure density; the function returns the final interval set after the specified rounds.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.00; competitive_ratio 1.00; num_intervals 302.
- **Feedback**: The deterministic gadget-based construction yields stable, reproducible intervals that respect clique-size constraints while driving color usage; it passes validation tests, though reliance on hard-coded patterns may limit generality to other instance settings.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 24 - Patch Name alternating_bridges_microcaps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hybrid Kierstead–Trotter interval generator**
- **Implementation**: Implements a four-round blow-up style construction starting from (0,1). Each round computes span = hi - lo, builds four scaled blocks with starts [2, 6, 10, 14], adds preload small intervals, appends either cloned or reversed-cloned copies of the previous round, inserts bridges, adjacent and global connectors, sparse caps, and two long sentries in round 0; the newly built set becomes the basis for the next round and the final T is returned.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.00; competitive_ratio 1.22; 2169 intervals generated.
- **Feedback**: The evaluator reports the program is incorrect and fails validation tests; likely issues include ad hoc scaling/assembly leading to invalid interval sets, potential duplicates or degenerate intervals, and lack of guarantees about ordering or constraint satisfaction. Suggested fixes involve validating constraints, deduplicating and sorting results, and tightening arithmetic to avoid edge-case misscalings.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 25 - Patch Name improved_kierstead_trotter - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Deterministic fractal-interval generator (FirstFit)**  
- **Implementation**: Core logic resides in construct_intervals, which seeds four disjoint unit intervals, defines four gadget templates and several deterministic start-pattern cycles, and iteratively expands the interval set over rounds by translating, bridging, and scaling blocks. Each round selects a pattern/template (cycled by roundIdx), clones and reverses blocks, adds inter-block bridges, appends a scaled gadget, injects a micro-gadget, and finally adds sparse cap intervals before updating the working set. The function is exposed via two run_experiment definitions, with the final one delegating to construct_intervals() ignoring incoming kwargs.  
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.00; competitive_ratio: 1.12; num_intervals: 2252; alg: 19; opt: 17.  
- **Feedback**: The approach yields stable, reproducible expansions due to deterministic pattern/template cycling, but relies on heavy, hard-coded constants which limit adaptability. A potential integration pitfall exists from having two run_experiment definitions, where the final one ignores kwargs, which could confuse callers. Overall, the method produces a large, fractal-like interval set consistent with the reported metrics.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 26 - Patch Name fractal_waveff - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Shrink + Spine-Blocker Builder**
- **Implementation**: Builds interval sets through multiple rounds by normalizing the current pattern to [0,1], applying a round-dependent width shrink and increasing block spacing, and placing long spine blockers before scaled normal intervals. Each block uses deterministic jitter, alternates inner order, and employs rotating templates and start patterns to vary alignment; additional light bridges and end caps pressure FirstFit locally, and an optional extra_rounds phase densifies starts with extended_starts and a central template.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.00; competitive_ratio: 1.00; num_intervals: 823.
- **Feedback**: The approach aggressively constrains omega by spacing and spine blockers while using normalization and shrinking to maintain scale stability; deterministic pattern rotation plus jitter improves reproducibility without full randomness, though added rounds increase complexity. Overall, it passes validation with the reported metrics.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 27 - Patch Name hierarchical_shrink_spine_blocks - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Iteratively build a sequence of open intervals by starting with (0,1) and repeating a fixed-depth, fixed-branching block construction. At each level, scale and translate copies of the current interval set T, reverse alternating blocks, and append adjacent and cross-connecting intervals to propagate colors while avoiding clique increases. The process uses parameters depth=4 and branching=7 and returns the final interval list T, with run_experiment exposing construct_intervals().
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.30; competitive_ratio 1.44; num_intervals 6801 generated (example output includes a large list of intervals).
- **Feedback**: The approach yields a deterministic, large-scale interval construction that passes validation tests and demonstrates strong blow-up behavior suitable for analyzing FirstFit performance. The implementation tightly couples scaling, offsets, and connectors to control color propagation without increasing cliques, though the resulting interval list is extensive and sensitive to the chosen depth/branching parameters.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 28 - Patch Name alternating_block_order - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Builder for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of translated and interwoven interval blocks across multiple rounds. It seeds with disjoint unit intervals, uses predefined template banks and start-patterns, applies bridges between blocks, adds micro-caps and sparse long caps, and scales all content by a round-specific delta to produce a recursive, wave-like construction.
- **Performance**: Competitive ratio ≈ 1.16 with 2365 intervals produced; combined score reported as 0.00.
- **Feedback**: The implementation employs a dense coupling strategy (bridges, micro-caps, long caps, and tower caps) to pressure FirstFit into using more colors while keeping omega controlled; it is self-contained and validated, though readability and parameter tuning could be improved for easier adaptation and analysis.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 30 - Patch Name bridged_wave_templates_v3 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Rotating Multiscale Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Deterministic rotating multiscale construction that starts from four seed unit intervals and builds blocks via rotated start patterns and a template gadget bank. It alternates clone orders, inserts light bridges, adds micro-gadgets and caps per round, and performs a second smaller-scale refinement phase to couple colors across scales; returns the final interval list T.
- **Performance**: Performance metrics show a competitive_ratio of about 1.18 with 2141 intervals generated (combined score to maximize = 0.00).
- **Feedback**: The implementation is correct and passes all validation tests. The multiscale, highly parameterized approach yields reproducible results and a decent competitive ratio, though further knob tuning could optimize interval count and runtime.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 31 - Patch Name rotating_multiscale - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Rotating-Template Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Depth-limited (depth=4) expansion uses a fixed bank of templates (A–E) applied in a rotating order. Each level translates and/or mirrors copies of the current gadget, placing them at scaled offsets, with alternated orientation, and adds connectors (adjacent and cross-block) plus a couple of seed intervals to encourage color pressure. The result is a deterministic list of (l, r) intervals produced by iterative grafting of the gadget.
- **Performance**: Final output contains 2029 intervals with a competitive_ratio of 1.18 and a combined score of 0.00, staying well under the 10000-interval bound due to the depth-limited, template-driven expansion.
- **Feedback**: The approach yields reproducible, bounded growth and deliberate color-pressure propagation through connectors and seeds. Minor code hygiene note: run_experiment is defined twice (the second overrides the first), which is harmless here but should be cleaned up for clarity. The template rotation and block alternation effectively break symmetry and keep omega modest while increasing the color palette.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 33 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic rotated four-block Kierstead–Trotter expansion**
- **Implementation**: Builds intervals by iteratively cloning four translated copies of the current block set, optionally reversing every odd block, and then appending a fixed set of connector intervals calculated from the chosen start pattern. Rotation of four-start patterns across rounds and integer-only arithmetic ensure deterministic growth without floating-point artifacts. A tiny optional phase-2 step can sprinkle sparse micro-intervals, but is disabled by default to keep counts near a target.
- **Performance**: Generates about 9.5k intervals (num_intervals = 9556) with a combined score of 1.30 and competitive_ratio about 1.86; the design yields a near-cap interval count while remaining deterministic and memory-stable.
- **Feedback**: The rotation and parity controls help avoid repetitive overlap and FF reuse, producing diverse interval layouts. Keeping phase2_iters at 0 preserves the target interval count; enabling phase2_iters provides a controllable, sparse augmentation at a smaller scale but can alter the count significantly. Overall, the approach uses explicit formulas for connectors and translations to remain robust and FP-free, suitable for evaluators requiring deterministic, well-scoped interval structures.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 34 - Patch Name rotated_fourblock_ktr - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Rotating Multiscale Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Implements a deterministic multi-round interval generator that builds and translates blocks of seed intervals using rotating start patterns, a 4-interval gadget template bank, bridges, towers, and caps. It supports tunable knobs (phase2_rounds, bridge_fraction, caps_per_round, micro_scale) and preserves seed_lo/seed_scale for compatibility; a two-phase refinement runs at a smaller delta to couple colors across scales.
- **Performance**: Outputs 321 intervals with a competitive_ratio of 1.00 and a neutral combined score of 0.00, indicating deterministic behavior and reproducibility within the validated tests.
- **Feedback**: Strengths: deterministic, reproducible construction with multi-scale coupling that keeps omega small via bridges and towers. Limitations: heavy, hard-coded knobs and ad-hoc patterns reduce readability and tunability; could benefit from modularization and clearer parameterization for evaluators.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 35 - Patch Name rotating_3start_towers_and_trimmed_finephase - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hybrid rotated-interleaved Kierstead-Trotter interval construction**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of open intervals by maintaining a current set T, generating four translated copies with optional reversal, rotating start patterns, and interleaving blocks to raise FirstFit pressure. Connectors couple blocks without forming large cliques, followed by an optional micro-phase tail. A safety cap (MAX_INTERVALS = 9800) and a growth-based depth reduction keep total intervals under control; coordinates are normalized to non-negative integers and endpoints are cast to int. Note: there are two run_experiment definitions; the latter overrides the former and ignores supplied kwargs.
- **Performance**: Evaluation reports a combined score of 1.10, competitive ratio around 1.83, and 152 intervals (e.g., a specific interval set is produced).
- **Feedback**: The design uses deterministic yet varied patterns (rotation, interleaving, and connectors) to stress FirstFit while avoiding large cliques; the explicit depth cap and micro-phase tail help bound growth and increase pressure. The duplicate run_experiment definition reduces configurability and could hide intended parameterization.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 36 - Patch Name rot_interleave_kierstead - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Rotated Four-Block Kierstead–Trotter Expansion**
- **Implementation**: Deterministic rotated expansion clones four translated copies of the current interval set per round (with optional reversal of every odd block), then appends connector intervals derived from the chosen starts; returns a list of open intervals in FF presentation order, with an optional tiny phase-2 micro-step (disabled by default).
- **Performance**: Composite score 1.30, competitive ratio 1.62, and 12,286 intervals produced, but evaluation indicates the implementation is incorrect and fails validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The approach relies on a fixed connector scheme and rotated starts, but lacks validation guarantees (e.g., disjointness or problem-specific invariants), leading to incorrect results. Additionally, run_experiment does not propagate kwargs to construct_intervals, limiting configurability and potentially contributing to validation failures.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 37 - Patch Name add_micro_connectors - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Deterministic Rotated Block Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Uses a deterministic bank of four-block start templates and a seed set of displaced unit intervals; it estimates rounds with a conservative connectors-per-round budget to stay under max_intervals, then iteratively translates, interleaves, and connects blocks; a micro-phase adds small gadgets and long caps before final normalization and integer conversion with truncation to the budget.
- **Performance**: Competitive_ratio: 1.08; num_intervals: 7693.
- **Feedback**: The approach yields a correct, deterministic construction that passes validation tests; the layered expansion (rotation, interleaving, connectors, micro-phase) effectively densifies intervals within budget, though the overall complexity could be reduced or better documented.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 38 - Patch Name rotated_tower_caps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Rotated Four-Block Kierstead–Trotter Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: The code builds a deterministic, rotated four-block interval construction (Kierstead–Trotter style) with connectors and optional interleaving. It uses helper routines: _max_depth_with_cap to cap growth, _build_rotated_blocks to generate translated blocks (with optional reversal), _interleave_blocks to mix blocks round-robin, _add_connectors to insert four deterministic cap-like connectors, and _normalize_to_non_negative to shift endpoints to non-negative integers. construct_intervals orchestrates rounds, updating the working set T, applying rotation, interleaving, and connectors, and optionally a tiny phase2_micro sprinkle near the end. A wrapper run_experiment(**kwargs) exposes the interface (though a second duplicate definition exists at the bottom).
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.80; competitive_ratio: 2.00; num_intervals: 148; produced a nontrivial set of intervals under a cap (≈9.8k) and validated as correct in tests.
- **Feedback**: The cap-driven depth control effectively prevents pathological growth, while rotation, reversal, and interleaving increase geometric diversity and potential forcing (FF) pressure. The presence of two run_experiment definitions (the latter overriding the former and not forwarding kwargs) is a subtle bug risk; overall, the approach yields correct results with modest interval counts, though there’s room to tune parameters (start patterns, delta handling, and ensuring kwargs propagation) for potential improvements.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 39 - Patch Name rotated_kierstead_trotter_v2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adaptive Kierstead–Trotter style four-block interval expander**
- **Implementation**: Builds four translated blocks per round from a deterministic bank of four start-pattern templates, with optional reversal for odd blocks. It adaptively caps recursion depth by simulating growth (size -> size*7 + 11) to respect max_intervals, then interleaves blocks (round-robin, with rotation and per-round parity effects), appends deterministic connectors, optionally performs a micro-phase sprinkling of long-range caps, and finally normalizes coordinates to non-negative integers while ensuring each interval has positive length and trimming to max_intervals.
- **Performance**: In the provided run, it produced 4005 intervals with a combined score of 1.20 and a competitive ratio of 1.71.
- **Feedback**: The approach leverages adaptive depth to bound interval growth and uses rotation/interleaving to diversify color usage, which helps avoid repeating overlap patterns; the micro-phase adds sparse long caps to perturb sparsely, and normalization/clamping ensure valid non-negative intervals within the limit. Potential areas for caution include reliance on deterministic templates and the sensitivity of the final interval distribution to max_intervals and round-robin ordering.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 40 - Patch Name adaptive_rotating_kt_with_adaptive_depth - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Enhanced four-block interval expansion with rotation**
- **Implementation**: A deterministic multi-round expansion builds four translated blocks per round from a base interval set T, with rotating start patterns, optional reversal of block order, and small preload blockers. It interleaves blocks, adds bridges between adjacent blocks, and appends fixed connectors before setting T for the next round. Final intervals are scaled by 1000 after shifting to non-negative coordinates and clipped to 10,000 entries.
- **Performance**: Competitive ratio ~1.31 with 6,139 intervals produced; output values are large-scale integers due to scaling, and the result is intentionally capped at 10k intervals.
- **Feedback**: The design uses rotation, interleaving, and parity-based reversal to diversify color interaction, with preloads and bridges to subtly couple colors. While deterministic and tunable, heavy scaling and a fixed cap may affect downstream usage or extreme-case behavior; floating-to-integer rounding could introduce minor precision artifacts.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 41 - Patch Name rotated_preload_four_block_expansion - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction**

- **Implementation**: Seeds with four disjoint unit intervals, then cycles through multiple deterministic start-patterns and a small bank of 4-interval connector templates. For each round, it translates and possibly reverses the current block T, inserts light-bridge intervals and short caps between blocks, appends scaled templates, and updates T to the newly built set S; span-based scaling and tiny offsets maintain relative structure while keeping the clique size low.

- **Performance**: Competitive_ratio ≈ 1.07 with 1874 intervals produced (combined score 0.00; rounds default to 4); evaluation reports a correct result with substantial interval growth.

- **Feedback**: The approach uses deterministic pattern cycling and per-round template variation to disrupt regular reuse while coupling colors via light bridges and caps without increasing omega much, yielding dense interval lists yet stable clique control. Potential refinements include reducing total interval count or tuning caps/bridges for tighter efficiency, and ensuring floating-point robustness across many rounds.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 42 - Patch Name rotate_templates_and_seed_expansion - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Rotated Kierstead–Trotter Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: A deterministic 4-block Kierstead–Trotter style generator builds adaptive-depth interval lists by translating a base block T across rounds, with optional features (rotate_starts, reverse_block_parity, interleave_blocks, micro_phase) to vary layout; it computes an adaptive depth cap from max_intervals, constructs blocks with delta-based translations, adds color-propagating connectors, and normalizes to non-negative integers before trimming to max_intervals.
- **Performance**: The run yields 9556 intervals under a 9800-cap, with a combined score of 1.90 and competitive_ratio of 2.71.
- **Feedback**: The approach is deterministic and budget-conscious via adaptive depth, providing diverse layouts through optional modes; micro_phase remains optional and can extend sparse long-range caps, though defaults produce valid results within the cap and pass validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 43 - Patch Name classic_4block_depth6 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Rotated Four-Block Kierstead–Trotter Expansion**
- **Implementation**: Builds an initial unit interval, then iteratively expands by cloning four translated copies per round using a rotating set of start patterns, optionally reversing every other block to disrupt reuse, and appending deterministically computed connectors; all arithmetic is integer-driven to avoid floating-point artifacts, with an optional tiny phase-2 micro-phase (default disabled).
- **Performance**: Delivers about 9,556 intervals (rounds=6) with a competitive ratio of ~2.71 and a combined score of 1.90; phase2_iters=0 keeps the count near the intended cap.
- **Feedback**: The rotation and parity toggles diversify interactions and hinder reuse, while the explicit integer arithmetic and deterministic connectors ensure reproducibility and stability; the phase-2 hook provides a controlled way to inject sparse long-range structure without inflating the interval count, and the approach is validated as correct under tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 44 - Patch Name fix_classic_pattern_defaults - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic rotating multiscale block construction**
- **Implementation**: Builds a deterministic sequence of open intervals by iterating through multiple rounds, starting from a seed set of four unit intervals. It uses rotating start patterns and a template bank to place translated clones of the seed, interleaves light bridges and occasional longer skips between blocks, adds micro-gadgets and sparse caps to shape FirstFit behavior, and finally runs a smaller-scale refinement phase before returning the final interval list.
- **Performance**: Achieves a competitive_ratio of 1.00 with 645 intervals (sampled output shown), and reports a combined score of 0.00 in the evaluation metrics.
- **Feedback**: The approach is highly deterministic and heavily parameterized (phase2_rounds, bridge_fraction, caps_per_round, micro_scale, etc.), yielding a dense, multi-scale interval set designed to pressure FirstFit while keeping omega small; the two-phase refinement helps couple colors across scales, but the large interval count may impose downstream costs and tuning complexity.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 45 - Patch Name dense_patterns_skip_bridges_sparse_caps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Open-Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: construct_intervals uses a six-round iterative construction. It keeps a current interval list T, computes delta from the span of T, translates a chosen start-pattern across T to form S, appends a set of connector intervals, and repeats with a cycling set of start-patterns; run_experiment delegates to construct_intervals.
- **Performance**: Reported metrics include a combined score of 1.80, competitive ratio of 2.57, and 9,556 intervals generated.
- **Feedback**: The implementation follows the Figure 4 strategy from the referenced arXiv work, leveraging multiple start-pattern templates to break periodic reuse and produce a large, self-contained interval sequence that passes validation tests; while effective, the large output size and deterministic design suggest potential for clearer documentation and tighter theoretical guarantees.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 46 - Patch Name rotate_start_patterns - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Multi-Round Interval Evolver**
- **Implementation**: Implements an adaptive, deterministic interval generator that seeds with four unit intervals and iteratively expands via translated copies of a four-interval base (templates) and a deterministic start-pattern cycle. Each round computes delta from current span, applies optional jitter, adds inter- and intra-round bridges, templates, caps, and occasional long spines to impose color coupling, and updates the working set T.
- **Performance**: Generates 1904 intervals with a competitive_ratio around 1.05; the combined score is 0.00, and tests report correctness.
- **Feedback**: Strengths include reproducible results with a small jitter to avoid symmetry and effective local coupling through bridges and caps. Considerations include the complexity from many interacting components (templates, patterns, caps, spines) which increases maintenance/tuning effort and may warrant ablation studies to understand component impact on scalability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 47 - Patch Name hybrid_wavecaps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Rotating Multi-Scale Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: The core is construct_intervals, a deterministic, multi-phase interval builder. It initializes with a small seed set, uses four interval templates (A–D), and a rotating-start scheme to place blocks. Each round clones and translates the seed blocks, inserts bridges, places scaled gadget templates, injects micro-gadgets, and adds sparse tower-like overlaps, then updates the seed for the next round. A final fine-scale phase scales the whole construction down and repeats a compact 3-wave pattern with bridges and cap-couplers, returning the final interval list.
- **Performance**: The run reports a competitive_ratio around 1.06 with 3165 intervals generated, indicating strong FF-approximation behavior while maintaining a substantial interval count. The coordinates become large due to repeated delta-based scaling, suggesting sensitivity to round count and scale parameters.
- **Feedback**: The design is solid for deterministic, reproducible interval generation with layered scales and varied topologies per round, achieving good competitive performance. However, the large number of intervals and floating-point coordinate magnitudes may impact runtime and numerical stability; tuning parameters (rounds, bridge sizes, and fine-scale factors) could reduce blowup while preserving accuracy.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 48 - Patch Name ff_pressure_rotating_multiscale - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic rotating multi-round interval builder**
- **Implementation**: Builds an initial compact core of four open intervals, then iteratively expands via four rotation templates and a deterministic sequence of start-patterns. Each round translates and optionally reverses the current block set, adds light bridges, global gadget blocks, a micro-gadget inside the middle block, and sparse caps; delta scaling normalizes across rounds, and the result becomes the input for the next round.
- **Performance**: Competitive_ratio 1.07; 1887 intervals generated; combined score reported as 0.00 (the run is deemed correct and passes validation tests).
- **Feedback**: The design uses deterministic knobs (seed_lo, seed_scale) and cyclized pattern templates to ensure reproducible, layered interval growth while attempting to limit omega through scaling and targeted gadgets; the approach yields a large interval set with clear structural phases, but may be computationally heavy for higher rounds and could benefit from tunable round/template parameters to control interval count.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 49 - Patch Name rotating_starts_template_bank_sparse_caps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Implements a six-round process that expands the current interval set T by translating four start-pattern blocks and interleaving them to maximize cross-block overlap. It then appends dynamic connectors (caps and crosses) based on the chosen starts, updates T, and finishes with a micro-phase that sprinkles sparse long-range caps before returning the final interval list.
- **Performance**: Performance achieves a competitive ratio of 2.22 with 9558 intervals and a combined score of 2.00, and the implementation passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Strengths include diversified start-pattern cycling to avoid periodic reuse and explicit connectors to boost overlap, yielding a robust, deterministic construction. The evaluation confirms correctness, but the large interval count may impact memory/time and could be a target for scalability optimizations.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 50 - Patch Name interleave_blocks - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Gadget Generator**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of intervals by iteratively composing a base spine of four unit intervals with multiple gadget templates and start patterns. Each round scales and translates blocks using delta, alternates inner block order, adds thin bridges between starts, embeds a core gadget and a micro-gadget anchored in the middle, and finally appends two sparse cap families before feeding the result into the next round; the run_experiment function simply returns the constructed interval list.
- **Performance**: Produces 643 intervals with a competitive_ratio of 1.20 and a combined score of 0.00, illustrating a dense but structured sequence intended to stress FirstFit while keeping clique growth controlled.
- **Feedback**: The approach is implemented to vary block order, embed gadgets, and scale components to influence color usage in FF tests; evaluation notes indicate correctness and passing validation tests, though the design relies on many hard-coded constants and pattern choices that could benefit from parameterization or justification for reproducibility.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 51 - Patch Name rotated_spine_templates - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hybrid two-phase recursive interval construction**
- **Implementation**: Builds an initial spine of four unit intervals, then performs Phase 1 with five depth expansions using predefined start patterns and connector templates to generate four scaled copies per iteration (with optional reversal of order), followed by Phase 2 with three mini-wave expansions that inject short interval waves and two cross-connectors per round. The final interval list is returned as floats. run_experiment simply invokes construct_intervals.
- **Performance**: The run yields a very large interval set (about 349,482 intervals) with coordinates in the hundreds of millions, achieving a competitive ratio around 1.07 but reporting a combined score of 0.00 in the provided metrics.
- **Feedback**: The evaluation flags the program as incorrect and not passing validation tests; potential issues include mismatches with the evaluator’s expected constraints or output format, possible data corruption in the reported metrics (truncated/corrupted log line), and brittleness from handcrafted patterns (pattern banks and modular indexing) that may not guarantee required invariants or robustness across test harnesses.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 29 - Patch Name hybrid_wave_expansion - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Adaptive Rotated Four-Block Interval Emitter**
- **Implementation**: Builds rounds of four translated blocks from a small seed interval, applying deterministic start patterns with optional rotation, parity-based reversal, and round-robin interleaving. It adaptively caps depth to respect max_intervals, adds deterministic connectors between blocks, optionally injects a micro-phase of sparse long-range caps, and normalizes/clips coordinates to non-negative integers.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.60; competitive ratio 1.78; intervals produced: 9,560.
- **Feedback**: Validation confirms correctness and passes tests; design choices (rotation, interleaving, and connectors) promote color mixing and interval spread while the adaptive depth cap guarantees budget adherence. Micro-phase adds sparse long-range caps without violating the cap, and normalization ensures non-negative, well-formed intervals.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 52 - Patch Name enable_rotation_and_micro - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic rotated four-block KT-style expansion**
- **Implementation**: A deterministic expansion that maintains a current interval set T and, per round, creates four translated copies (with optional reversal parity), interleaves them round-robin, and appends four connectors derived from the chosen starts; an optional micro-phase can sparsely add long-range intervals.
- **Performance**: Generates roughly 9.5k intervals for 6 rounds (near the intended cap), with output being deterministic and near the target interval count.
- **Feedback**: The combination of rotation, interleaving, and parity reversal effectively disrupts overlap patterns and enhances coverage; connectors enforce color-chaining, and phase2_iters offers a tunable, sparse augmentation at some cost to count. Overall, the approach provides a controllable, repeatable construction with clear trade-offs between density and pattern diversity.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 53 - Patch Name enable_interleave_and_defaults - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adaptive Kierstead–Trotter Block Expansion**
- **Implementation**: Maintains a dynamic set T of open intervals and expands it in rounds by translating four blocks drawn from a deterministic start-pattern bank, computing delta from current bounds to levy translations, and then forming a new set S. It applies optional rotation, parity reversal, and round-robin interleaving to mix colors, adds a deterministic connector set, optionally runs a micro-phase that injects long-range caps with a two-phase mini-expansion, and finally normalizes coordinates and clips to max_intervals.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 1.20; competitive_ratio: 1.71; max_intervals: 9800; produced 9800 intervals as exemplified by the long coordinates listed.
- **Feedback**: The adaptive depth cap enforces a hard bound on the total number of intervals by incrementally growing size with a 7x growth plus connectors and stopping when the next expansion would exceed max_intervals. The rotation, reversal, and interleaving strategies promote color mixing and avoid large cliques, while the micro-phase adds sparse long-range caps, but coordinates can become very large and the approach is sensitive to parameter settings, impacting downstream usage.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 54 - Patch Name two_phase_micro_expansion - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Multi-Block Interval Crossover**
- **Implementation**: Builds intervals via seeds and multiple start-pattern templates, then expands rounds by translating and optionally reversing blocks, interleaving in round-robin order, and appending lightweight blockers plus deterministic connectors. Depth is adaptively chosen to fit a max_intervals cap; a micro-phase can sprinkle long-range caps; final normalization ensures non-negative, positive-length intervals and a final cap.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.40, competitive_ratio 1.56; produced 5803 intervals under a 9800-cap, with correct validation.
- **Feedback**: The method is fully deterministic with clear, modular heuristics (rotation, interleaving, blockers, connectors) that reliably pressure FirstFit while keeping clique growth in check. It relies on fixed templates and depth heuristics; consider parameterizing or documenting choices for portability and potential optimization.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 55 - Patch Name ff_kierstead_crossover - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT Fixed-Start Interval Evolve (FF Pressure)**
- **Implementation**: The function construct_intervals builds an expanding sequence T of open intervals by iteratively translating a base pattern using four fixed starts (2, 6, 10, 14), concatenating translated blocks, and appending four delta-based connectors (left cap, right cap, cross 1, cross 2) before repeating for six rounds; this follows the classic KT construction to maximize FirstFit pressure.
- **Performance**: The run reports a combined score of 1.90 with competitive_ratio 2.71, using 9556 intervals in total.
- **Feedback**: The approach sticks to a deterministic fixed-start KT construction (no micro-phase), yielding a large interval set and moderate competitive ratio; while correct and validated, it trades simplicity for higher interval count, suggesting potential gains from experimenting with micro-phase or alternative starts.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 56 - Patch Name classic_fixed_starts_no_interleave - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Interleaved Multi-Scale Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Generates multi-round, deterministic interval sequences by building per-round blocks from rotating start patterns, translating cloned base 4-interval seeds, interleaving blocks in round-robin order, and appending bridges, rotating template gadgets, a micro-gadget, and tiered towers with varying layers and spans; a second phase adds finer-scale coupling with a smaller delta. All behavior is controlled by knobs (rounds, bridge_fraction, caps_per_round, micro_scale, interleave_blocks) to ensure reproducible, experiment-driven variation.
- **Performance**: Produces 1317 intervals with competitive_ratio 1.00; overall evaluation score shown as 0.00 and validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: The deterministic interleaving and multi-scale layering effectively increase overlap among active colors and density, enabling reproducible experiments across rounds; the approach is parameter-rich but complex, which aids experimentation while challenging readability and maintenance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 57 - Patch Name interleaved_rotating_multiscale - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Recursive Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Seeds four disjoint unit intervals to form an initial spine, then iteratively expands via rounds that rotate among deterministic 4-start patterns and a bank of 4-interval templates. Each round translates and optionally reverses inner blocks, inserts short bridges and caps, conditionally interleaves blocks, and finally appends a small micro-phase; the result is a list of open intervals (l, r) in presentation order.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 1.10; competitive_ratio: 1.10; num_intervals: 469.
- **Feedback**: The design yields deterministic yet varied geometry through round-wise block ordering and inner-order flips, with interleaving and a micro-phase to diversify color interactions; evaluation confirms correctness and validation tests pass, though performance is governed by the implemented strategy rather than runtime optimization.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 58 - Patch Name rotate_template_seed_caps_phase2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Sequence Constructor**
- **Implementation**: Seeds four disjoint unit intervals and iteratively builds translated copies using cycling start-patterns and a per-round template bank. It introduces light bridges, 4-interval connectors, sparse caps, and occasional long spines to diversify color coupling while updating the working set T each round.
- **Performance**: Competitive_ratio 1.06 with 1908 total intervals; the run reports alg: 19 and opt: 18, indicating a stable yet heavy interval construction process.
- **Feedback**: The approach effectively diversifies patterns to disrupt regular FirstFit coloring while keeping the clique number small; the deterministic seeds and layered gadgets yield reproducible results, though the interval count grows substantially and may affect runtime.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 59 - Patch Name rotation_sequence_and_long_spines - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Rotating Multiscale Wave Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Implements rotating multiscale construction: seeds T, per-round translation/scaling using start patterns and templates, interleaving blocks with bridges and micro gadgets, plus a phase-2 refinement and final normalization. Returns a list of open intervals (l, r) in presentation order for FirstFit.
- **Performance**: Generates 1071 intervals with a 9000-interval cap under defaults; deterministic behavior.
- **Feedback**: Deterministic and validation-friendly, producing a dense, multi-scale interval set with many colors. The safety cap and normalization help bound output, though the construction can be computationally intensive as rounds increase.

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Below is a focused synthesis of concrete performance data and implementation details from the evaluated programs, with emphasis on the current best pattern and how it compares to others.

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns

- Current best pattern: EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
  - Core technique: six-round delta-driven expansion from a compact seed, using multiple start-pattern templates and interleaving translated blocks to maximize cross-block overlap.
  - Key implementation choices driving improvement:
    - Multi-round delta-expansion with fixed seed T = [(0,1)] and a rotating set of four-start templates: start_patterns = [(2,6,10,14), (1,5,9,13), (3,7,11,15), (2,4,8,12)]. This cadence reduces reuse patterns and promotes diverse color interactions.
    - Interleaving translated blocks (zip-like merging) across the four translated copies in each round. This interleaving increases cross-block overlap and color distribution efficiency, contributing to stronger FirstFit pressure per interval.
    - Explicit, deterministic connectors tied to the delta and chosen starts: left cap, right cap, cross 1, cross 2. These add long-range interactions without inflating the interval count uncontrollably.
    - A micro-phase at the end that injects sparse long-range caps (delta2-based) to sprinkle long-range structure without a wholesale expansion.
  - Performance outcome (as the current best): 9,558 intervals, combined score 2.00, competitive_ratio 2.22. The large-scale, multi-scale integration with interleaving and connectors yields the strongest FF-pressure among the evaluated variants.

- Notable supporting patterns with similar ideas but different outcomes:
  - Gen 52 - Adaptive Rotated Four-Block Interval Emitter: score 1.60, 9,560 intervals. Benefits from rotation and interleaving to promote color mixing, plus a depth cap to respect max_intervals. Still behind EVOLVE-BLOCK-START, suggesting the specific delta-expansion + connector integration in EVOLVE-BLOCK-START adds meaningful value.
  - Gen 53 - Deterministic rotated four-block KT-style expansion: roughly 9.5k intervals, deterministic with round-robin interleaving and connectors; score not as high as EVOLVE-BLOCK-START, showing the superiority of the delta-interleaving-connector combination in the best pattern.
  - Gen 54 - Adaptive Kierstead–Trotter Block Expansion: 9.8k intervals, but score 1.20; demonstrates that adding a micro-phase alone without the effective multi-round delta-expansion and interleaving does not reach the best score.

- Patterns that validate the value of structure and micro-phase together:
  - The combination of rotation/repetition of start-patterns, interleaving, and connectors (as in EVOLVE-BLOCK-START) consistently yields higher scores than patterns relying solely on scale, gadgets, or fixed starts without coherent cross-scale interactions.

## Ineffective Approaches

- High-interval-count, low-penetration patterns:
  - Gen 19 (very large/noisy patterns): tens of thousands of intervals with a combined score of 0.00 and validation issues. Lesson: scale alone does not guarantee FF-pressure or correctness.
  - Gen 26 (deterministic fractal-interval generator) and Gen 27/Gen 30 (gadget-heavy patterns): produce some structure but end up with a combined score of 0.00 or poor FF-pressure, indicating misalignment between growth mechanics and the evaluator’s objective.
- Incorrect/hygiene-related issues undermining validity:
  - Gen 37 (Rotated Four-Block Kierstead–Trotter Interval Generator) is explicitly incorrect and fails validation despite a large interval count; rotation alone is insufficient without invariants alignment.
  - Gen 36 and Gen 37 show duplicate run_experiment definitions, blocking reliable exploration and reproducibility.
- Small-scale approaches with insufficient scale:
  - Gen 39 (148 intervals; ratio ~2.00) yields a modest combined score (~0.80). This reinforces that small-scale constructions can look good on a ratio basis but fail to deliver meaningful FirstFit pressure, due to limited cross-scale interactions.
- Takeaway: Approaches that rely on scale or gadget density without integrating a coherent delta-expansion framework, inter-block interleaving, and cross-scale connectors tend to underperform or fail validation, underscoring the importance of cohesive multi-scale design.

## Implementation Insights

- What makes the current best effective
  - Delta-driven, self-similar expansion with a compact seed across multiple rounds, where each round translates and expands four blocks derived from the current set T. This creates a structured, multi-scale geometry that feeds FirstFit pressure more effectively than flat expansion.
  - Interleaving translated blocks in a round-robin, block-by-block fashion. This “zip” merging increases local overlap between colors and prevents dominance by any single translated block, boosting color usage efficiency per interval.
  - Deterministic connectors (left cap, right cap, cross 1, cross 2) that couple blocks across scales. Connectors are computed from delta and chosen starts, ensuring long-range interactions without exploding the total count. This helps distribute colors across the interval graph.
  - Micro-phase enrichment at the end adds sparse long-range caps (delta2-based) to pepper the structure with cross-scale interactions without a combinatorial explosion in intervals.
  - Deterministic start-pattern cycling (2,6,10,14; 1,5,9,13; 3,7,11,15; 2,4,8,12) reduces symmetry and avoids early stagnation, contributing to more robust FF-pressure over rounds.
  - Clear anchoring with an initial interval T = [(0,1)] ensures stable base geometry and predictable delta computations across rounds.
- Concrete implementation details linked to performance
  - Interleave translated blocks carefully to avoid skewed growth: the code constructs blocks for each start, then merges by iterating i from 0 to maxlen and appending the i-th interval from each block in turn. This ensures cross-block overlap is maximized from the outset.
  - Connectors derived from delta and starts: for example, left cap uses delta*(s0-1) and delta*(s1-1), right cap uses delta*(s2+2) and delta*(s3+2), cross-1 uses delta*(s0+2) and delta*(s2-1), cross-2 uses delta*(s1+2) and delta*(s3-1). This systematic, formula-driven construction enforces long-range coupling without ad-hoc additions.
  - Micro-phase delta2 = max(1, (hi-lo)//4) and micro blocks [(lo+delta2, lo+5*delta2), (hi-6*delta2, hi-2*delta2)]. This targeted augmentation injects sparse long-range caps without destabilizing the overall interval count or structure.
  - Budget discipline: six rounds with a fixed seed and a cap-like growth patternstabilize the total interval count around the 9k-10k range, enabling strong FF-pressure without runaway growth.
- Why these choices align with performance data
  - The strong performance (2.00 combined score) occurs where the pattern integrates localized block growth (delta-expansion), cross-scale mixing (interleaving), and targeted long-range interactions (connectors + micro-phase). Other patterns that lack one of these components tend to underperform, especially when they rely solely on scale or gadgets.

## Performance Analysis

- Overall trends and comparisons
  - EVOLVE-BLOCK-START: 9,558 intervals; combined score 2.00; competitive_ratio 2.22. This is the top performer among large-scale patterns, demonstrating the payoff of a tightly integrated delta-expansion with interleaving and connectors plus micro-phase.
  - Close peers with large scales but different design choices:
    - Gen 56 - classic fixed starts with micro-phase: ~9,556 intervals; combined score 1.90; competitive_ratio 2.71. Slightly lower score despite a higher ratio, suggesting that the interleaving and explicit connectors in EVOLVE-BLOCK-START contribute beyond what fixed-start scaffolding alone can achieve.
    - Gen 52 - Adaptive Rotated Four-Block Emitter: 9,560 intervals; combined score 1.60; ratio 1.78. Rotation and interleaving help, but the score is still below EVOLVE-BLOCK-START’s multi-pattern delta-expansion synergy.
  - Deterministic KT-style and multi-block approaches:
    - Gen 53 and Gen 55 show deterministic, interleaved builds with connectors; scores around 1.3–1.4 range, indicating deterministic but less effective cross-scale coupling than EVOLVE-BLOCK-START.
  - Micro-phase-only or small-scale approaches:
    - Gen 54 and Gen 28 show benefits from micro-phases or interleaving, but their scores are generally lower than the six-round delta-expansion with connectors, reinforcing that the combination of all components yields the strongest pressure.
- Observations on scale versus score
  - Large-scale patterns tend to achieve higher combined scores when they integrate cross-block interleaving and long-range connectors, as seen with EVOLVE-BLOCK-START, Gen 56, and Gen 52. Merely increasing interval counts (without effective cross-scale interaction) does not guarantee higher scores (Gen 19 and others with huge counts often fail validation or yield low scores).
  - The best results consistently arise when multi-round growth is coupled with explicit cross-scale interactions (connectors) and a micro-phase that selectively adds long-range structure.

In summary, the current best program EVOLVE-BLOCK-START demonstrates that the strongest FirstFit pressure arises from a cohesive combination of:
- delta-driven multi-round expansion with a compact seed,
- interleaved, multi-block translations per round,
- deterministic cross-scale connectors, and
- a targeted micro-phase augmentation.

These components together outperform other large-scale, pattern-based approaches and validate the value of tightly integrated multi-scale design over purely scalable or gadget-dense but poorly coupled patterns. The evidence is reinforced by direct comparisons to near-top patterns (Gen 52, Gen 53, Gen 56) and by the documented failures of brittle or misaligned approaches (Gen 37, Gen 19, Gen 26, Gen 27, Gen 30, and hygiene issues in Gen 36/37). The current best remains the reference for how these techniques interact to maximize FF-pressure under the evaluation constraints.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1) Add a two-phase delta expansion: a small second phase with delta2
- Implement a second expansion phase after the initial six rounds, using delta2 = max(1, floor(delta/2)) and the same four-start template bank. Run 2–3 additional rounds in this second phase before applying the micro-phase, then proceed as before. This preserves the strong multi-scale coupling while filling gaps in color distribution, aligning with the observed benefit of multi-scale structure without large interval blowups.

2) Introduce a delta-block template bank and cycle it deterministically
- Create a bank of delta-block templates (A, B, C, D, …) each defining a distinct arrangement of the four translated blocks. Cycle through the bank in a fixed sequence across rounds (e.g., A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, …) rather than reusing the same four-start pattern every round. This diversifies long-range connectors and cross-scale interactions without sacrificing reproducibility, matching the success pattern that outperformed fixed-start approaches.

3) Seed the initial T with multiple disjoint intervals
- Initialize T with several disjoint intervals, e.g., T = [(0,1), (2,3), (4,5), (6,7)], instead of a single seed. This increases early cross-block interactions and color mixing when translating blocks, amplifying FirstFit pressure from the outset while remaining deterministic and scalable across rounds.

4) Add controlled inner-order variation to interleaving every two rounds
- Alternate the interleaving order every two rounds (e.g., forward order for rounds 0–1, then reverse order for rounds 2–3, then forward again for 4–5, etc.). This deterministic variation disrupts potential stagnation patterns in block reuse while preserving the overall zip-like merging benefit, effectively increasing per-interval color usage without exploding the interval count.

5) Extend the start-pattern cycle to an 8-round, multi-pattern schedule
- Move from a 4-pattern cycle to an 8-round schedule (e.g., sequence: A, B, C, D, A, B, C, D or a slightly re-ordered variant) so the cadence of starts remains diverse over longer runs. This reduces the risk of regression from repeating the exact same cycle across more rounds and enhances cross-round color interactions, consistent with the observed advantage of multi-pattern, multi-round planning in EVOLVE-BLOCK-START.
