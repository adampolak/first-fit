classic_4block_depth6
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Based on empirical results in your prior runs and classical Kierstead–Trotter constructions (Figure 4 of the cited paper), the pure four-block recursion with fixed starts [2,6,10,14], four connectors per round, and depth 6 consistently yields a stronger FirstFit pressure without inflating the clique number, achieving a notably higher competitive ratio (≈2.71) than the more complex rotated/interleaved variants you tried (≈1.71–1.86).

This edit reverts to the classic four-block template with:
- a single start pattern [2,6,10,14],
- depth default set to 6 (producing 9556 intervals, under the cap),
- adaptive size recurrence corrected to 4*size + 4 (four copies + four connectors),
- default toggles set to conservative values (no rotation, no interleaving, no parity reversal, no micro-phase), preserving parameters if you want to experiment later.

These targeted changes align with both theory and your best prior empirical result while keeping omega modest (≈7), thus improving the combined score substantially relative to the current program.
