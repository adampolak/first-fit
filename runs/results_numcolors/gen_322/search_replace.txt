expand_template_bank
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Expand the KT template bank from four to six templates by adding two auxiliary templates.
This increases cross-scale template diversity (more varied block offsets across rounds),
which helps FirstFit reuse fewer colors between rounds and tends to raise the online color count
without materially increasing the clique number. This is a conservative, low-risk change
that preserves all existing code structure.
