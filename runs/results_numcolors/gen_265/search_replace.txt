parity_interleave_alt_windows_and_cross_scale_connectors
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
I enable parity-based interleaving on the main KT spine (even rounds interleave, odd rounds sequential) to increase FirstFit pressure without substantially raising the clique number. I then add a small, deterministic cross-scale connector pack positioned by fractional span to couple colors across distant regions at low omega cost. Finally, I upgrade the micro-phase to alternate two distinct window families across iterations, reversing interleaving order on odd iterations and adding a longer-range cross connector on the alternate phase. These changes are CAP-aware and deterministic, aiming to push FF beyond the prior 2.30 ratio while keeping omega ≈ 10, leveraging proven KT-like structure with careful arrival-order engineering and cross-scale coupling.
