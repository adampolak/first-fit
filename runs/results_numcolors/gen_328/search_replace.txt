interleave_boost_alt_expansion
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Always interleave spine blocks for maximal color mixing, adjust reverse parity for variation, increase spine‐density boost and densification seed sizes to amplify FirstFit pressure, and expand the alternate micro‐phase with a larger seed and an extra window to create more cross‐coupling without increasing omega.
