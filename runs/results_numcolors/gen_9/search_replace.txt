<NAME>generalized_branching_connectors</NAME>
<DESCRIPTION>
Generalize the recursive construction by introducing parameters for recursion depth and branching factor, and replace the fixed 4‐block layout with a dynamic pattern of `branching` scaled copies plus adjacent and cross connectors. Setting `branching=7` and `depth=4` yields about 6801 intervals, with FirstFit using 25 colors over a clique size of 5, achieving a competitive ratio of 5.0 while keeping total intervals under 10000.
