 def construct_intervals():
   """
   Construct a sequence of intervals of real line,
   in the order in which they are presented to FirstFit,
-  so that it maximizes the number of colors used by FirstFit
-  divided by the maximum number of intervals that cover a single point
+  so that it tends to maximize the number of colors used by FirstFit
+  divided by the maximum number of intervals that cover a single point.
 
-  The initial implementation uses the construction from
-  Figure 4 in https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00192
+  New approach: rotating_template_wave
+  - Depth-controlled multi-block expansion.
+  - A bank of templates (offset patterns) rotated deterministically per level.
+  - Each level places multiple translated copies of the current gadget with alternating orientation.
+  - Adds local connectors between blocks to propagate color usage but keeps omega small.
+  - Deterministic and keeps total number of intervals under practical limits.
 
   Returns:
     intervals: list of tuples, each tuple (l, r) represents an open interval from l to r
