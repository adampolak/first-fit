skip_micro_by_cap
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
We want to preserve the strong six-round KT spine, which empirically yields a higher FirstFit/omega ratio, and avoid the subsequent micro-phase that inflates omega and degrades the ratio. The current code proceeds to Stage 2 unless it is “near the cap.” By lowering CAP from 9800 to 9560 (just above the six-round size 9556), we guarantee:
- All six spine rounds still run, since 9556 ≤ CAP.
- The “near-cap” early return triggers after stage 1 (because 9556 ≥ CAP − 16), skipping the micro-phase.
This minimal change is consistent with the rest of the code and should restore the stronger ratio observed in prior runs (~2.7), improving the combined score without risking capacity overflow.
