disable_interleave_and_microphase_guard
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
The current implementation interleaves blocks on even rounds and runs a delta2 micro-phase, both of which increase local overlap and push the clique number from 8 to 9, degrading the FirstFit/omega ratio to ~2.33. Prior runs show that the classic KT spine without interleaving and without the micro-phase attains a stronger ratio (~2.50) with roughly the same interval budget.

This edit makes three targeted adjustments:
- Disable interleaving in all rounds to reduce peak overlap while preserving the color-coupling pressure of the KT connectors.
- Default-disable the micro-phase (phase2_iters=0) so it does not run unless explicitly requested.
- Tighten the capacity cap to 9560 to guarantee the micro-phase is skipped even when requested, while still permitting the full six KT rounds.

These changes aim to drop omega back to 8 while keeping FirstFit high (around 20), thereby improving the competitive ratio and the combined score, with minimal code changes and within the interval budget.
