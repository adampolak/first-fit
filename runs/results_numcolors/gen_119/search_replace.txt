fixed_spine_with_parity_blocks
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
We revert to a fixed-start spine to match the strongest prior performance and wire in an optional block-parity reversal that was previously unused. Empirically, the fixed (2,6,10,14) starts with sequential block ordering yielded a higher competitive ratio in earlier runs. We therefore set rotate_starts to False by default. Additionally, we modify the block builder to support per-block reversal (reverse every odd-indexed block when reverse_block_parity is enabled), which is a classic trick to inhibit color reuse across blocks without increasing the clique number. The default remains disabled (False) to preserve the previously best behavior, but the capability is now available for further tuning. These targeted changes keep the construction small-omega while increasing FF pressure.
