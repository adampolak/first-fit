delta2_micro_phase_and_sequential_spine
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
I replace the even-round interleaving in the main KT spine with a fully sequential spine to reduce omega growth and improve stability, and I remove the simplistic three-cap micro-phase. In its place, I add a capacity-guarded, two-round delta2-driven micro-phase inspired by Kierstead–Trotter constructions: thin seeding, parity-based interleaving across four translated blocks, and sparse localized connectors (including a longer cross3). This mirrors the successful strategy from the prior best variants, which consistently achieved FF≈22 and OPT≈10 under CAP. The new micro-phase boosts FirstFit pressure via cross-scale coupling without inflating the clique number, while the CAP guard keeps the total intervals under 10000. This should improve combined_score from the current 2.00 back towards the stronger 2.20 tier.
