multi_round_wave_expansion
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Introduce a small, self-contained enhancement to the interval construction that uses a deeper recursive, multi-round wave expansion. This aims to increase the number of colors used by FirstFit (FF) without increasing the offline optimum (omega) too much, by injecting additional transformation waves in later rounds and expanding the set of shifts. The default rounds=3 preserves backward compatibility while providing a clear path to stronger constructions if needed. The change is self-contained within construct_intervals and preserves the overall interface.
