extended_template_bank
</NAME>
<DESCRIPTION>
Expand the KT spine’s rotating-template bank from 4 to 6 patterns by adding two auxiliary start-templates. This increases backbone diversity and cross-scale color mixing without raising the clique number, leveraging proven auxiliary templates to strengthen FirstFit pressure.

post_tail_long_range_caps
</NAME>
<DESCRIPTION>
After injecting the near-tail caps, append two additional long-range connectors spanning almost the full current span. These post-tail caps further couple many active colors at the end of the spine, coercing FirstFit into higher color usage without significantly increasing ω.
