<DESCRIPTION>
Add two extra long-range cross connectors (cross 3 and cross 4) on even spine rounds. These connectors span further scales (s0+3,s3+3 and s0+4,s3+4), coupling distant blocks and increasing FirstFit pressure without significantly raising the clique number. This should push FF to use more colors by creating new overlaps across layers.
