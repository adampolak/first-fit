interleaved_connectors
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Interleave primary connector intervals after each block instead of appending at the end, and add additional cross-layer connectors between nonconsecutive blocks to force FirstFit to allocate extra colors without increasing the clique number. This ladder-like insertion increases interference across blocks, raising the FirstFit color usage while keeping the maximum overlap at four.
