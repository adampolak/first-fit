six_template_two_pass_connectors
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
I implement three targeted changes aligned with high-performing strategies for pushing FirstFit colors while controlling omega:

1) Expand the KT spine to a six-template rotation to improve cross-scale coupling and color mixing. This diversifies block placements while retaining the proven safe four-block structure. I replace the previous four-template bank with six carefully chosen templates inspired by KT variants used in the literature.

2) Enable a long-range cross connector on the final spine round. This deterministic connector increases inter-block coupling without materially increasing omega, as it is added only once and at the top scale.

3) Switch to a deterministic two-pass micro-phase by default (adaptive_micro=False). The current code already performs a primary micro round followed by an alternate-window micro round when not adaptive; setting the default to False enforces a two-pass budgeted micro-phase rather than iterative growth, which empirically increases FF pressure without destabilizing omega.

4) Append 4 deterministic long-range connectors after the alternate micro-phase, positioned in disjoint fractional windows of the global span. These connectors are conservative and capacity-gated, intended to further tie colors across layers while staying under the clique cap.

These changes should strengthen color coupling across scales and phases, increasing FF’s color usage without pushing the clique number beyond 10, and remain within the 9800 interval cap.
