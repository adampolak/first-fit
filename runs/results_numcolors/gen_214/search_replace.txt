second_micro_phase_and_cross4
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
I introduce two targeted enhancements inspired by known strategies for pushing FirstFit without inflating the clique number:

1) Enable a final long-range cross4 connector during the last backbone (spine) round when cross4_enabled is True. This adds a single long-range connector that couples distant blocks across the scale, leveraging the strong colors accumulated by the spine while keeping additional overlap sparse (so omega remains controlled).

2) Add a second, distinct fractional-window micro-phase (with windows [(0.05, 0.15), (0.28, 0.38), (0.60, 0.70), (0.82, 0.92)]) that activates after the primary micro-phase, capacity-gated. This is aligned with the recommendation to run a second micro-phase using a different window set to boost FF pressure without densifying any single point excessively. To support this, the micro-round builder now accepts an optional window_fracs parameter.

Additionally, I set the default phase2_iters to 2, allowing two primary micro rounds by default when capacity permits; all micro-phases are CAP-guarded so the total count stays under 9800.

These changes preserve the existing strong behavior (competitive ratio ~2.30) while offering a principled pathway to increased FF usage by more robust cross-scale coupling and a second micro-phase using distinct windows.
