# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: The function construct_intervals builds a sequence of open intervals starting from T = [(0, 1)], then repeats twice: compute lo, hi, and delta = hi - lo, build S by scaling and translating each interval in T by delta*s for s in (2, 6, 10, 14), then append four fixed delta-scaled blocks (delta*1, delta*5), (delta*12, delta*16), (delta*4, delta*9), (delta*8, delta*13); set T = S and return the final list of 36 intervals. The run_experiment wrapper simply returns construct_intervals(); intervals are represented as open intervals (l, r).
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.70; competitive ratio 2.33; number of intervals 36 (alg: 7; opt: 3).
- **Feedback**: The implementation follows the two-phase, delta-scaled expansion inspired by the referenced figure, yielding a deterministic, reproducible interval sequence that passes validation tests. The presence of a commented Figure-3 alternative indicates explorations of different OPT/FF configurations, suggesting room for further optimization or variant testing.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 0 - Patch Name initial_program - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of open intervals T by starting with (0,1) and, for six iterations, computing delta = current span (hi - lo). It expands T by adding scaled copies of all current intervals (offsets delta*start for start in 2,6,10,14) and then appending four fixed blocks (delta*1 to delta*5, delta*12 to delta*16, delta*4 to delta*9, delta*8 to delta*13). The result is assigned back to T each iteration and returned; run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.90; competitive_ratio 2.71 with 9556 intervals generated.
- **Feedback**: The code faithfully implements the Figure 4 construction from the referenced paper and passes all validations, producing a large, scalable interval set; however, the resulting interval count and numeric magnitude can be substantial, which may impact runtime in larger runs.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 1 - Patch Name deepen_recursive_figure4_to_6 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Kierstead-Trotter Interval Blow-Up Builder**
- **Implementation**: Recursively builds interval blocks starting from T=[(0.0,1.0)], and at each depth expands by four scaled copies placed at offsets [2,6,10,14] times the current span, shifting by base = off*span - lo; then adds four connector intervals to form an FF chain, repeating for the given depth. A run_experiment wrapper calls construct_intervals; there is a second, redundant run_experiment definition present.
- **Performance**: Evaluation reports a competitive ratio of 2.50 with 148 intervals produced (combined score to maximize: 1.00).
- **Feedback**: The implementation yields a self-similar, scalable FF-chain interval sequence through span-based scaling and explicit connectors, though the duplicate run_experiment definition is a minor code quirk that could confuse readers; depth controls growth and numerical scales are floating-point.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 2 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-inspired Block Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: Parameterized recursive construction builds T starting from [(0,1)], and at each depth creates S by placing 2+4*i scaled copies (i in 0..branching-1) of the current T shifted by a base computed from span and lo. It also adds adjacent connectors between blocks and optional cross-block connectors (based on branching) before iterating. The final T after the last depth is returned as a list of open intervals in presentation order.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.00; competitive_ratio: 1.00; num_intervals: 1561.
- **Feedback**: Clear KT-inspired scaling and connector strategy are implemented and validated (default depth=4, branching=5 yield 1561 intervals). However, the approach scales rapidly with depth and branching, and the code lacks optimization or memoization, limiting efficiency for larger parameters.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 3 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Wave-based FirstFit interval generator**
- **Implementation**: The code builds a sequence of open intervals by starting with T = [(0,1)], and iteratively expanding it over a number of rounds. In each round it computes lo, hi, and delta from T, shifts the entire current set by delta * start for a list of starts (expanding in later rounds), appends four local blocks to create overlapping waves, and updates T until completion; the final list T is returned as the interval set.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 1.00; competitive_ratio: 2.50; num_intervals: 548, indicating a large, validated adversarial instance suitable for FirstFit testing.
- **Feedback**: The implementation faithfully realizes the recursive wave construction described in the docstring and yields a sizeable interval set that passes validation tests; the approach is compact and self-contained but could benefit from parameterization and clearer documentation of the local-block rationale and coordinate scaling.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 4 - Patch Name multi_round_wave_expansion - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Wave Construction for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of intervals by iteratively generating dense "wave" blocks over rounds, duplicating and sometimes reversing the current interval set, inserting short bridges between blocks, adding a small four-interval gadget, and appending sparse cap intervals to keep omega small; the process uses delta-scaled transformations and offsets to place blocks, with a final returned interval list.
- **Performance**: Competitive evaluation shows competitive_ratio 1.00 with 353 intervals and an overall score of 0.00 (alg: 11; opt: 11).
- **Feedback**: The approach leverages alternating inner order, bridging, and caps to maximize FirstFit colors while controlling clique size; while it achieves an optimal competitive ratio in tests, the score indicates no measured gain from optimization, suggesting room for parameter tuning and code clarity improvements.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 5 - Patch Name layered_caps_bridged_rounds2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Recursive wave interval construction for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Starts with (0,1) and, for a given number of rounds, expands the current interval set by translating and scaling it with delta = hi - lo, where lo and hi bound the existing intervals. It uses a fixed sequence of shifts (starts = [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16]) to generate translated copies, then appends a small set of local blocks to create overlapping waves, updating the interval list each round; run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals().
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.70; competitive_ratio 1.40; 100 intervals generated in the final set.
- **Feedback**: The design relies on a dense, hard-coded shift pattern to amplify FirstFit color usage via recursive wave expansion, with performance tied to these fixed choices. Evaluation shows the approach achieves the stated metrics and reproducible results, though the heavy reliance on predetermined patterns may limit generalization and adaptability to other configurations.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 6 - Patch Name denser_starts_two_rounds - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction**

- **Implementation**: Builds a hierarchical, wave-like set of intervals by iterating up to 4 rounds, computing a dynamic delta from current interval extents, and assembling blocks with preload blockers, cloned (or reversed) bases, and bridges between adjacent blocks. Each block contributes a mix of short blockers, cloned intervals, and a bridging interval; additional local gadgets, sparse caps, and occasional long sentries are added before updating the working interval set T for the next round. The main entry point run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals() with default rounds.

- **Performance**: Competitive-driven metrics report a competitive_ratio of 1.13 with 2609 intervals generated; algorithm identifier alg: 17 and optimum opt: 15, and a combined performance score of 0.00, with the implementation validated as correct.

- **Feedback**: The implementation employs arrival-order engineering (alternating clone order, preload blockers, bridges) to pressure First-Fit usage while capping growth through a rounds limit and structured layering (preloads, bridges, caps). This yields substantial interval counts but keeps the offline optimum small; the approach passes validation tests, though parameter choices (block starts, preload counts, and cap spacing) could be tuned for different trade-offs between interval count and color usage pressure.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 7 - Patch Name improved_wave_preload - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Recursive Wave Interval Evolver for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: The algorithm starts with T = [(0, 1)] and iteratively expands it for a specified number of rounds. In each round it finds lo, hi, and delta from T, expands T by translating copies of T using a round-specific set of starts (smaller set in round 0, larger set in later rounds), appends several local blocks to create overlapping waves, and then replaces T with the new set; run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals() with the default rounds=2.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.70; competitive_ratio: 1.40; number of intervals: 174; produced intervals show a mix of small and extended blocks crafted to stress FirstFit.
- **Feedback**: The approach is correct and aligns with a known two-round pattern extended to multiple rounds, using deliberate start offsets and local blocks to push color usage while controlling omega; tuning the rounds or start sets could improve the competitive ratio, and the trailing commentary hints minor documentation cleanup opportunities.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 8 - Patch Name adaptive_wave_density_and_caps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: FirstFit adversarial interval blow-up construction**
- **Implementation**: A deterministic, recursive interval generator parameterized by depth=4 and branching=7. Starting from T = [(0,1)], each level scales and offsets copies of the previous block, using delta based on the current range (lo, hi). It builds S by duplicating T at offsets delta*start (for starts = 2,6,10,...), then appends adjacent and cross-block connectors to enforce color propagation constraints, and iterates. The final list T is returned as the interval sequence (open intervals as (l, r)). run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals.
- **Performance**: Generates 6,801 intervals with a competitive ratio of about 1.44 and a combined score around 1.30, illustrating a substantial blow-up designed to stress FirstFit.
- **Feedback**: The implementation uses a clear, parameterizable blow-up strategy that deterministically constructs adversarial inputs for FirstFit. While effective at creating large inputs and a high color-count-to-overlap ratio, the interval count scales aggressively with depth/branching, and the results depend on fixed parameters; the approach is solid but brittle-to-tune for different evaluation settings.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 9 - Patch Name generalized_branching_connectors - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-inspired interval blow-up construction**
- **Implementation**: Recursive construction starts from T0 = [(0, 1)]. Each depth computes the current span and creates four scaled copies at offsets 2, 6, 10, 14 of the span, then inserts ladder connectors between adjacent blocks, adds cross-layer connectors between nonconsecutive blocks, and includes original figure connectors before updating T = S; the final interval list is returned. A run_experiment wrapper invokes construct_intervals with depth defaulting to 4.
- **Performance**: Competitive ratio: 1.00; number of intervals: 851; combined score to maximize: 0.00.
- **Feedback**: The implementation is correct and passes all validation tests; it uses a KT-like recursive blow-up with explicit connectors to maintain structure, resulting in a deterministic, scalable interval sequence whose size grows with depth (851 intervals at depth=4).
**Program Identifier:** Generation 10 - Patch Name interleaved_connectors - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Adaptive Multi-Round Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Builds an initial core interval, then iteratively expands via translated copies of the current set across a round-dependent list of starts. It alternates using the current set and its reverse, inserts bridging intervals between consecutive starts, and appends a fixed four-interval gadget plus three small caps to influence color usage and omega trade-offs. The process relies on a delta computed from the current interval span and scales all coordinates accordingly; the result is a deterministic, seed-based interval list.
- **Performance**: With default parameters (rounds=3, seed_lo=0.0, seed_scale=1.0), the evaluator reports 2866 intervals and a competitive score/ratio of 1.20.
- **Feedback**: The design favors deterministic, seedable expansion with adaptive start sets to control growth and diversify interval placement (via alternating order and bridging). The combination of gadgets and caps aims to push FF usage while keeping omega small, but it yields a sizeable interval count; parameterizing starts, bridging, and gadget placement could help tune performance and scalability for larger round counts.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 11 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Constructor**

- **Implementation**: Starts from a seed of disjoint unit intervals and grows a sequence using a small bank of four-interval templates plus a deterministic, round-dependent start-pattern cycle. Each round deterministically selects a start pattern and a template based on round index, expands copies of the current set T (alternating between T and reversed(T) to reduce reuse), scales all intervals by a delta derived from the current range, appends the scaled template, and adds a few sparse caps near the starts to couple colors without large omega growth. The process iterates for a configurable number of rounds, returning the final interval set.

- **Performance**: Evaluation reports a combined score of 1.00 with a competitive ratio of 1.25, generating 1417 intervals in total.

- **Feedback**: The approach is correct and passes all validation tests; design choices (seed diversification, template bank, and non-self-similar sequencing) appear to support robust FirstFit behavior within the evaluated constraints.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 12 - Patch Name template_cycle_multi_seed_expansion - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Multi-Round Wave Interval Constructor**
- **Implementation**: Seeds with four disjoint unit intervals, then iteratively expands via rounds that select deterministic start patterns and templates, translates copies of the current set with delta-scaling, alternates inner order to hinder color reuse, bridges between consecutive starts, appends scaled templates, and finally adds sparse caps to subtly pressure color usage; the process yields a new interval set for the next round.
- **Performance**: Reported as a combined score of 1.30 (competitive_ratio 1.30) producing 1,631 intervals.
- **Feedback**: The approach uses deterministic templates and cross-round translations to promote overlap and color coupling, yielding dense interval sets; while predictable, the resulting interval count grows substantially, suggesting a trade-off between coupling and scalability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 13 - Patch Name wavecraft_opt - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Wave-Constructive Evolving Block Intervals**
- **Implementation**: Builds a multi-round sequence of real-line intervals by seeding with four disjoint unit blocks, then per round selecting a 4-interval template and a start-pattern to generate scaled copies with bridges, a middle-gadget injection, and two sparse cap families; it alternates block order (original vs reversed) to hinder FirstFit reuse, adds inter-block bridges (including second-next links on some rounds), and uses a middle-block gadget and delta-scaling to control growth. Each round transforms the current block set into a larger S with careful scaling and then sets T = S for the next round.
- **Performance**: Achieves a competitive_ratio of 1.11 with 2380 intervals generated (combined score 0.00 in the provided metrics).
- **Feedback**: The approach yields moderate FirstFit pressure while constraining omega growth through sparse bridging, templated variation, and gadget injections; it uses deterministic round-based patterning to maintain reproducibility and passes validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 14 - Patch Name bridges_microgadgets_and_dual_caps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic 4-branch interval builder with templates**
- **Implementation**: Builds a deterministic sequence of open intervals by iterating a 4-branch growth with 4 connectors per level. Each iteration selects a start pattern, varies block order, toggles clone order (T or reversed(T)) for each block, and appends four connectors from a rotating template bank; the current span scales offsets for clones, then connectors are scaled by the iteration span.
- **Performance**: Fixed depth of 6 yields 9556 intervals with a competitive_ratio of ~1.18 and a reported combined score of 0.00; results are reproducible due to fixed seeds and deterministic ordering.
- **Feedback**: The diversification of arrival order, clone order, and connector templates reduces FirstFit reuse and improves variety while keeping growth predictable; the implementation is correct and passes validation tests, though memory grows rapidly with depth and could be tuned for larger scopes.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 15 - Patch Name cyclic_wave_diversifier - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Multi-Round Wave Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Starts with four unit intervals, then iteratively expands for a number of rounds by selecting a start pattern and a template, translating copies of the current set with deterministic jitter and occasional reversal, and bridging consecutive blocks to encourage color coupling. It appends the chosen template scaled by the round delta, adds sparse caps to pressure color usage, and replaces the working set T each round; optional extra rounds use an extended, fixed scheme before returning T.
- **Performance**: Produces 1748 intervals with a competitive_ratio of 1.06 and a neutral combined score of 0.00, with all behavior being fully deterministic due to the seeded jitter.
- **Feedback**: The deterministic jitter and templated expansion yield reproducible, densely interconnected interval sets aimed at stressing FirstFit-like algorithms; tuning rounds, extra_rounds, and cap strategy can significantly affect density and pressure, suggesting opportunities for parameter refinement to balance coverage and performance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 16 - Patch Name break_self_similarity_with_jitter_and_extra_rounds - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Adaptive Multi-round Interval Waves**
- **Implementation**: Starts from a compact core of four seed intervals and, for a fixed number of rounds, expands by translating and scaling copies of the current interval set relative to its [lo, hi] span; employs alternating base order, bridging between adjacent blocks, and adds gadget/micro-gadget blocks plus small caps to influence interval distribution, returning a list of open-interval endpoints.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.00; competitive_ratio 1.07 with 6302 intervals produced; 15 construction steps across 3 rounds, and validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: The deterministic, adaptive expansion yields near-optimal competitive performance while generating a large but controlled interval set; however, the approach relies on many hard-coded constants (starts, gadget shapes) that hurt readability and tunability, suggesting brittleness for future adjustments.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 17 - Patch Name multi_seed_and_micro_gadget - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Recursive Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: The algorithm builds a spine of four disjoint unit intervals and then performs three rounds of translated copies controlled by start patterns. Each round translates copies (alternating inner order via base = T or reversed(T)), applies a delta scaling (delta = hi−lo, or 1.0 if degenerate), adds light bridges between consecutive starts, injects a fixed 4-interval gadget scaled by delta, and appends sparse caps around interior block indices. The resulting set becomes the new spine for the next round and is finally returned as the open-interval sequence.
- **Performance**: Competitive_ratio is 1.07 with 675 intervals generated; the combined score is reported as 0.00, and the intervals span large scaled ranges, reflecting the multi-round translation and layering strategy.
- **Feedback**: The approach systematically hinders FirstFit reuse by alternating inner order, bridging between blocks, and injecting gadgets while keeping omega small, achieving a solid ratio at the cost of a relatively large interval count. Potential improvements could target reducing interval count or parameterizing rounds/start patterns for efficiency gains.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 18 - Patch Name three_round_spine_bridges_caps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-style interval blow-up (3-depth)**
- **Implementation**: Recursively build an interval sequence starting from [(0.0, 1.0)]. Each depth level computes the current span and creates four scaled copies of the existing blocks at offsets [2, 6, 10, 14] of span, then appends four connector intervals to link the blocks into a single chain; the process repeats for the specified depth. The function returns intervals in presentation order; run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals() with the default depth.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.00; competitive_ratio 2.50; 148 intervals generated.
- **Feedback**: The approach matches the intended Kierstead–Trotter style blow-up and yields a deterministic, correct sequence (validated by tests); depth-3 execution produces the expected 148 intervals, and the implementation is straightforward and reproducible.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 20 - Patch Name preload_rotate_improve_ff - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Two-Phase Evolve-Block Interval Constructor**
- **Implementation**: Builds a deterministic, two-phase interval sequence over a fixed depth, starting from a seed of disjoint unit intervals and iteratively expanding with rotated/reversed block orders, preload blockers, short bridges, clone-ordered copies of the previous set, and template-bank connectors; a set of long sentries is added once to bias color usage, and the current interval set becomes the base for the next iteration.
- **Performance**: Competitive_ratio ≈ 1.09 with 56,088 intervals; overall evaluation score reported as 0.00 and validations fail.
- **Feedback**: The approach uses a structured, multi-phase strategy to stress FirstFit while limiting omega, but validation tests fail, suggesting edge-case or connector-logic issues; the produced data also shows signs of brittleness (e.g., large/coerced coordinates and potential formatting/truncation anomalies).
**Program Identifier:** Generation 19 - Patch Name two_phase_preload_sentries - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Kierstead-Trotter Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Recursively builds a float interval sequence starting from T0 = [(0.0, 1.0)]. At each level, four blocks are placed at offsets [2, 6, 10, 14] of the current span; the block order is alternated by level (reverse on odd levels). Each block inserts a small number of preload blockers inside the block, then appends a clone of the current pattern T (reversed on alternating levels). Bridges between adjacent blocks and four global connector intervals are added, and the result becomes the new T for the next depth iteration.
- **Performance**: Competitive ratio 1.25 with 1531 intervals generated; evaluation shows a Combined score of 0.00.
- **Feedback**: The implementation is correct and passes validation tests; the gadget scaffolding (blockers, bridges, and alternating clone order) yields a varied interval layout and controlled growth, though the interval count grows rapidly with depth.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 21 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolving block gadget intervals for FF coloring**
- **Implementation**: The core is construct_intervals, which builds a sequence of open intervals by iterative rounds. Each round seeds a set T of disjoint unit intervals, then selects a pair of gadget templates and a start-pattern cycle. It clones and translates T into multiple blocks (reversing on alternating blocks), bridges between blocks, appends a scaled gadget template, adds short caps around each start, and finally inserts longer sparse caps to couple distant colors. The result is scaled by delta (based on current T span) and shifted by lo, producing a final list of (l, r) intervals in arrival order.
- **Performance**: The run_experiment path simply calls construct_intervals with default parameters, yielding a reported competitive_ratio of about 1.17 with 1918 intervals (and a zero aggregate score in the provided metrics). The approach is deterministic across rounds due to fixed start_patterns and templates, producing a large, highly structured interval set.
- **Feedback**: The implementation employs multiple gadget templates, deterministic start-pattern cycling, and cross-block coupling (bridges and sparse caps) to influence FirstFit behavior. This yields rich interval interaction and a high interval count, but the evaluation output shows a heavy, float-based interval construction with complex spacing; tuning seed_scale, rounds, and pattern choices could further normalize interval ranges or improve the observed metrics.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 22 - Patch Name recursive_wave_crossover - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic multi-round wave interval builder**
- **Implementation**: Builds multi-round, delta-scaled interval sets using a seed of four unit intervals, a bank of four-interval templates, and three start-pattern sequences. Each round translates or reverses the base intervals, adds light bridging between adjacent blocks, appends a template, and then adds sparse caps before using the result as the new base for the next round. Includes a second, overriding run_experiment definition that ignores kwargs and calls construct_intervals with defaults.
- **Performance**: Evaluated with 3 rounds by default, achieving 1748 intervals and a competitive_ratio of 1.07 (Combined score 0.00); the report notes the program is correct and passes validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The design purposefully preserves a low clique number while coupling colors via bridging and alternating inner orders; delta-scaling and templates aim to increase First-Fit pressure. The presence of an overriding run_experiment that ignores kwargs could cause confusion or unintended usage in some evaluators.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 23 - Patch Name delta_wave_templates_bridges - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of scaled interval blocks across a small number of rounds, using alternating block order (T vs reversed(T)), delta-based scaling, thin bridges between blocks, a fixed four-interval gadget, and an embedded micro-gadget near the median start. The starts list changes between rounds, and sparse caps are added to gently pressure density; the function returns the final interval set after the specified rounds.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.00; competitive_ratio 1.00; num_intervals 302.
- **Feedback**: The deterministic gadget-based construction yields stable, reproducible intervals that respect clique-size constraints while driving color usage; it passes validation tests, though reliance on hard-coded patterns may limit generality to other instance settings.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 24 - Patch Name alternating_bridges_microcaps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hybrid Kierstead–Trotter interval generator**
- **Implementation**: Implements a four-round blow-up style construction starting from (0,1). Each round computes span = hi - lo, builds four scaled blocks with starts [2, 6, 10, 14], adds preload small intervals, appends either cloned or reversed-cloned copies of the previous round, inserts bridges, adjacent and global connectors, sparse caps, and two long sentries in round 0; the newly built set becomes the basis for the next round and the final T is returned.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.00; competitive_ratio 1.22; 2169 intervals generated.
- **Feedback**: The evaluator reports the program is incorrect and fails validation tests; likely issues include ad hoc scaling/assembly leading to invalid interval sets, potential duplicates or degenerate intervals, and lack of guarantees about ordering or constraint satisfaction. Suggested fixes involve validating constraints, deduplicating and sorting results, and tightening arithmetic to avoid edge-case misscalings.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 25 - Patch Name improved_kierstead_trotter - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Deterministic fractal-interval generator (FirstFit)**  
- **Implementation**: Core logic resides in construct_intervals, which seeds four disjoint unit intervals, defines four gadget templates and several deterministic start-pattern cycles, and iteratively expands the interval set over rounds by translating, bridging, and scaling blocks. Each round selects a pattern/template (cycled by roundIdx), clones and reverses blocks, adds inter-block bridges, appends a scaled gadget, injects a micro-gadget, and finally adds sparse cap intervals before updating the working set. The function is exposed via two run_experiment definitions, with the final one delegating to construct_intervals() ignoring incoming kwargs.  
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.00; competitive_ratio: 1.12; num_intervals: 2252; alg: 19; opt: 17.  
- **Feedback**: The approach yields stable, reproducible expansions due to deterministic pattern/template cycling, but relies on heavy, hard-coded constants which limit adaptability. A potential integration pitfall exists from having two run_experiment definitions, where the final one ignores kwargs, which could confuse callers. Overall, the method produces a large, fractal-like interval set consistent with the reported metrics.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 26 - Patch Name fractal_waveff - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hierarchical Shrink + Spine-Blocker Builder**
- **Implementation**: Builds interval sets through multiple rounds by normalizing the current pattern to [0,1], applying a round-dependent width shrink and increasing block spacing, and placing long spine blockers before scaled normal intervals. Each block uses deterministic jitter, alternates inner order, and employs rotating templates and start patterns to vary alignment; additional light bridges and end caps pressure FirstFit locally, and an optional extra_rounds phase densifies starts with extended_starts and a central template.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.00; competitive_ratio: 1.00; num_intervals: 823.
- **Feedback**: The approach aggressively constrains omega by spacing and spine blockers while using normalization and shrinking to maintain scale stability; deterministic pattern rotation plus jitter improves reproducibility without full randomness, though added rounds increase complexity. Overall, it passes validation with the reported metrics.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 27 - Patch Name hierarchical_shrink_spine_blocks - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Iteratively build a sequence of open intervals by starting with (0,1) and repeating a fixed-depth, fixed-branching block construction. At each level, scale and translate copies of the current interval set T, reverse alternating blocks, and append adjacent and cross-connecting intervals to propagate colors while avoiding clique increases. The process uses parameters depth=4 and branching=7 and returns the final interval list T, with run_experiment exposing construct_intervals().
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.30; competitive_ratio 1.44; num_intervals 6801 generated (example output includes a large list of intervals).
- **Feedback**: The approach yields a deterministic, large-scale interval construction that passes validation tests and demonstrates strong blow-up behavior suitable for analyzing FirstFit performance. The implementation tightly couples scaling, offsets, and connectors to control color propagation without increasing cliques, though the resulting interval list is extensive and sensitive to the chosen depth/branching parameters.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 28 - Patch Name alternating_block_order - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Builder for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of translated and interwoven interval blocks across multiple rounds. It seeds with disjoint unit intervals, uses predefined template banks and start-patterns, applies bridges between blocks, adds micro-caps and sparse long caps, and scales all content by a round-specific delta to produce a recursive, wave-like construction.
- **Performance**: Competitive ratio ≈ 1.16 with 2365 intervals produced; combined score reported as 0.00.
- **Feedback**: The implementation employs a dense coupling strategy (bridges, micro-caps, long caps, and tower caps) to pressure FirstFit into using more colors while keeping omega controlled; it is self-contained and validated, though readability and parameter tuning could be improved for easier adaptation and analysis.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 30 - Patch Name bridged_wave_templates_v3 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Rotating Multiscale Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Deterministic rotating multiscale construction that starts from four seed unit intervals and builds blocks via rotated start patterns and a template gadget bank. It alternates clone orders, inserts light bridges, adds micro-gadgets and caps per round, and performs a second smaller-scale refinement phase to couple colors across scales; returns the final interval list T.
- **Performance**: Performance metrics show a competitive_ratio of about 1.18 with 2141 intervals generated (combined score to maximize = 0.00).
- **Feedback**: The implementation is correct and passes all validation tests. The multiscale, highly parameterized approach yields reproducible results and a decent competitive ratio, though further knob tuning could optimize interval count and runtime.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 31 - Patch Name rotating_multiscale - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Rotating-Template Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Depth-limited (depth=4) expansion uses a fixed bank of templates (A–E) applied in a rotating order. Each level translates and/or mirrors copies of the current gadget, placing them at scaled offsets, with alternated orientation, and adds connectors (adjacent and cross-block) plus a couple of seed intervals to encourage color pressure. The result is a deterministic list of (l, r) intervals produced by iterative grafting of the gadget.
- **Performance**: Final output contains 2029 intervals with a competitive_ratio of 1.18 and a combined score of 0.00, staying well under the 10000-interval bound due to the depth-limited, template-driven expansion.
- **Feedback**: The approach yields reproducible, bounded growth and deliberate color-pressure propagation through connectors and seeds. Minor code hygiene note: run_experiment is defined twice (the second overrides the first), which is harmless here but should be cleaned up for clarity. The template rotation and block alternation effectively break symmetry and keep omega modest while increasing the color palette.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 33 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic rotated four-block Kierstead–Trotter expansion**
- **Implementation**: Builds intervals by iteratively cloning four translated copies of the current block set, optionally reversing every odd block, and then appending a fixed set of connector intervals calculated from the chosen start pattern. Rotation of four-start patterns across rounds and integer-only arithmetic ensure deterministic growth without floating-point artifacts. A tiny optional phase-2 step can sprinkle sparse micro-intervals, but is disabled by default to keep counts near a target.
- **Performance**: Generates about 9.5k intervals (num_intervals = 9556) with a combined score of 1.30 and competitive_ratio about 1.86; the design yields a near-cap interval count while remaining deterministic and memory-stable.
- **Feedback**: The rotation and parity controls help avoid repetitive overlap and FF reuse, producing diverse interval layouts. Keeping phase2_iters at 0 preserves the target interval count; enabling phase2_iters provides a controllable, sparse augmentation at a smaller scale but can alter the count significantly. Overall, the approach uses explicit formulas for connectors and translations to remain robust and FP-free, suitable for evaluators requiring deterministic, well-scoped interval structures.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 34 - Patch Name rotated_fourblock_ktr - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Rotating Multiscale Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Implements a deterministic multi-round interval generator that builds and translates blocks of seed intervals using rotating start patterns, a 4-interval gadget template bank, bridges, towers, and caps. It supports tunable knobs (phase2_rounds, bridge_fraction, caps_per_round, micro_scale) and preserves seed_lo/seed_scale for compatibility; a two-phase refinement runs at a smaller delta to couple colors across scales.
- **Performance**: Outputs 321 intervals with a competitive_ratio of 1.00 and a neutral combined score of 0.00, indicating deterministic behavior and reproducibility within the validated tests.
- **Feedback**: Strengths: deterministic, reproducible construction with multi-scale coupling that keeps omega small via bridges and towers. Limitations: heavy, hard-coded knobs and ad-hoc patterns reduce readability and tunability; could benefit from modularization and clearer parameterization for evaluators.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 35 - Patch Name rotating_3start_towers_and_trimmed_finephase - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hybrid rotated-interleaved Kierstead-Trotter interval construction**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of open intervals by maintaining a current set T, generating four translated copies with optional reversal, rotating start patterns, and interleaving blocks to raise FirstFit pressure. Connectors couple blocks without forming large cliques, followed by an optional micro-phase tail. A safety cap (MAX_INTERVALS = 9800) and a growth-based depth reduction keep total intervals under control; coordinates are normalized to non-negative integers and endpoints are cast to int. Note: there are two run_experiment definitions; the latter overrides the former and ignores supplied kwargs.
- **Performance**: Evaluation reports a combined score of 1.10, competitive ratio around 1.83, and 152 intervals (e.g., a specific interval set is produced).
- **Feedback**: The design uses deterministic yet varied patterns (rotation, interleaving, and connectors) to stress FirstFit while avoiding large cliques; the explicit depth cap and micro-phase tail help bound growth and increase pressure. The duplicate run_experiment definition reduces configurability and could hide intended parameterization.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 36 - Patch Name rot_interleave_kierstead - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Rotated Four-Block Kierstead–Trotter Expansion**
- **Implementation**: Deterministic rotated expansion clones four translated copies of the current interval set per round (with optional reversal of every odd block), then appends connector intervals derived from the chosen starts; returns a list of open intervals in FF presentation order, with an optional tiny phase-2 micro-step (disabled by default).
- **Performance**: Composite score 1.30, competitive ratio 1.62, and 12,286 intervals produced, but evaluation indicates the implementation is incorrect and fails validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The approach relies on a fixed connector scheme and rotated starts, but lacks validation guarantees (e.g., disjointness or problem-specific invariants), leading to incorrect results. Additionally, run_experiment does not propagate kwargs to construct_intervals, limiting configurability and potentially contributing to validation failures.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 37 - Patch Name add_micro_connectors - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Deterministic Rotated Block Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Uses a deterministic bank of four-block start templates and a seed set of displaced unit intervals; it estimates rounds with a conservative connectors-per-round budget to stay under max_intervals, then iteratively translates, interleaves, and connects blocks; a micro-phase adds small gadgets and long caps before final normalization and integer conversion with truncation to the budget.
- **Performance**: Competitive_ratio: 1.08; num_intervals: 7693.
- **Feedback**: The approach yields a correct, deterministic construction that passes validation tests; the layered expansion (rotation, interleaving, connectors, micro-phase) effectively densifies intervals within budget, though the overall complexity could be reduced or better documented.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 38 - Patch Name rotated_tower_caps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Rotated Four-Block Kierstead–Trotter Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: The code builds a deterministic, rotated four-block interval construction (Kierstead–Trotter style) with connectors and optional interleaving. It uses helper routines: _max_depth_with_cap to cap growth, _build_rotated_blocks to generate translated blocks (with optional reversal), _interleave_blocks to mix blocks round-robin, _add_connectors to insert four deterministic cap-like connectors, and _normalize_to_non_negative to shift endpoints to non-negative integers. construct_intervals orchestrates rounds, updating the working set T, applying rotation, interleaving, and connectors, and optionally a tiny phase2_micro sprinkle near the end. A wrapper run_experiment(**kwargs) exposes the interface (though a second duplicate definition exists at the bottom).
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.80; competitive_ratio: 2.00; num_intervals: 148; produced a nontrivial set of intervals under a cap (≈9.8k) and validated as correct in tests.
- **Feedback**: The cap-driven depth control effectively prevents pathological growth, while rotation, reversal, and interleaving increase geometric diversity and potential forcing (FF) pressure. The presence of two run_experiment definitions (the latter overriding the former and not forwarding kwargs) is a subtle bug risk; overall, the approach yields correct results with modest interval counts, though there’s room to tune parameters (start patterns, delta handling, and ensuring kwargs propagation) for potential improvements.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 39 - Patch Name rotated_kierstead_trotter_v2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adaptive Kierstead–Trotter style four-block interval expander**
- **Implementation**: Builds four translated blocks per round from a deterministic bank of four start-pattern templates, with optional reversal for odd blocks. It adaptively caps recursion depth by simulating growth (size -> size*7 + 11) to respect max_intervals, then interleaves blocks (round-robin, with rotation and per-round parity effects), appends deterministic connectors, optionally performs a micro-phase sprinkling of long-range caps, and finally normalizes coordinates to non-negative integers while ensuring each interval has positive length and trimming to max_intervals.
- **Performance**: In the provided run, it produced 4005 intervals with a combined score of 1.20 and a competitive ratio of 1.71.
- **Feedback**: The approach leverages adaptive depth to bound interval growth and uses rotation/interleaving to diversify color usage, which helps avoid repeating overlap patterns; the micro-phase adds sparse long caps to perturb sparsely, and normalization/clamping ensure valid non-negative intervals within the limit. Potential areas for caution include reliance on deterministic templates and the sensitivity of the final interval distribution to max_intervals and round-robin ordering.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 40 - Patch Name adaptive_rotating_kt_with_adaptive_depth - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Enhanced four-block interval expansion with rotation**
- **Implementation**: A deterministic multi-round expansion builds four translated blocks per round from a base interval set T, with rotating start patterns, optional reversal of block order, and small preload blockers. It interleaves blocks, adds bridges between adjacent blocks, and appends fixed connectors before setting T for the next round. Final intervals are scaled by 1000 after shifting to non-negative coordinates and clipped to 10,000 entries.
- **Performance**: Competitive ratio ~1.31 with 6,139 intervals produced; output values are large-scale integers due to scaling, and the result is intentionally capped at 10k intervals.
- **Feedback**: The design uses rotation, interleaving, and parity-based reversal to diversify color interaction, with preloads and bridges to subtly couple colors. While deterministic and tunable, heavy scaling and a fixed cap may affect downstream usage or extreme-case behavior; floating-to-integer rounding could introduce minor precision artifacts.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 41 - Patch Name rotated_preload_four_block_expansion - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction**

- **Implementation**: Seeds with four disjoint unit intervals, then cycles through multiple deterministic start-patterns and a small bank of 4-interval connector templates. For each round, it translates and possibly reverses the current block T, inserts light-bridge intervals and short caps between blocks, appends scaled templates, and updates T to the newly built set S; span-based scaling and tiny offsets maintain relative structure while keeping the clique size low.

- **Performance**: Competitive_ratio ≈ 1.07 with 1874 intervals produced (combined score 0.00; rounds default to 4); evaluation reports a correct result with substantial interval growth.

- **Feedback**: The approach uses deterministic pattern cycling and per-round template variation to disrupt regular reuse while coupling colors via light bridges and caps without increasing omega much, yielding dense interval lists yet stable clique control. Potential refinements include reducing total interval count or tuning caps/bridges for tighter efficiency, and ensuring floating-point robustness across many rounds.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 42 - Patch Name rotate_templates_and_seed_expansion - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Rotated Kierstead–Trotter Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: A deterministic 4-block Kierstead–Trotter style generator builds adaptive-depth interval lists by translating a base block T across rounds, with optional features (rotate_starts, reverse_block_parity, interleave_blocks, micro_phase) to vary layout; it computes an adaptive depth cap from max_intervals, constructs blocks with delta-based translations, adds color-propagating connectors, and normalizes to non-negative integers before trimming to max_intervals.
- **Performance**: The run yields 9556 intervals under a 9800-cap, with a combined score of 1.90 and competitive_ratio of 2.71.
- **Feedback**: The approach is deterministic and budget-conscious via adaptive depth, providing diverse layouts through optional modes; micro_phase remains optional and can extend sparse long-range caps, though defaults produce valid results within the cap and pass validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 43 - Patch Name classic_4block_depth6 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Rotated Four-Block Kierstead–Trotter Expansion**
- **Implementation**: Builds an initial unit interval, then iteratively expands by cloning four translated copies per round using a rotating set of start patterns, optionally reversing every other block to disrupt reuse, and appending deterministically computed connectors; all arithmetic is integer-driven to avoid floating-point artifacts, with an optional tiny phase-2 micro-phase (default disabled).
- **Performance**: Delivers about 9,556 intervals (rounds=6) with a competitive ratio of ~2.71 and a combined score of 1.90; phase2_iters=0 keeps the count near the intended cap.
- **Feedback**: The rotation and parity toggles diversify interactions and hinder reuse, while the explicit integer arithmetic and deterministic connectors ensure reproducibility and stability; the phase-2 hook provides a controlled way to inject sparse long-range structure without inflating the interval count, and the approach is validated as correct under tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 44 - Patch Name fix_classic_pattern_defaults - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic rotating multiscale block construction**
- **Implementation**: Builds a deterministic sequence of open intervals by iterating through multiple rounds, starting from a seed set of four unit intervals. It uses rotating start patterns and a template bank to place translated clones of the seed, interleaves light bridges and occasional longer skips between blocks, adds micro-gadgets and sparse caps to shape FirstFit behavior, and finally runs a smaller-scale refinement phase before returning the final interval list.
- **Performance**: Achieves a competitive_ratio of 1.00 with 645 intervals (sampled output shown), and reports a combined score of 0.00 in the evaluation metrics.
- **Feedback**: The approach is highly deterministic and heavily parameterized (phase2_rounds, bridge_fraction, caps_per_round, micro_scale, etc.), yielding a dense, multi-scale interval set designed to pressure FirstFit while keeping omega small; the two-phase refinement helps couple colors across scales, but the large interval count may impose downstream costs and tuning complexity.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 45 - Patch Name dense_patterns_skip_bridges_sparse_caps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Open-Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: construct_intervals uses a six-round iterative construction. It keeps a current interval list T, computes delta from the span of T, translates a chosen start-pattern across T to form S, appends a set of connector intervals, and repeats with a cycling set of start-patterns; run_experiment delegates to construct_intervals.
- **Performance**: Reported metrics include a combined score of 1.80, competitive ratio of 2.57, and 9,556 intervals generated.
- **Feedback**: The implementation follows the Figure 4 strategy from the referenced arXiv work, leveraging multiple start-pattern templates to break periodic reuse and produce a large, self-contained interval sequence that passes validation tests; while effective, the large output size and deterministic design suggest potential for clearer documentation and tighter theoretical guarantees.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 46 - Patch Name rotate_start_patterns - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Multi-Round Interval Evolver**
- **Implementation**: Implements an adaptive, deterministic interval generator that seeds with four unit intervals and iteratively expands via translated copies of a four-interval base (templates) and a deterministic start-pattern cycle. Each round computes delta from current span, applies optional jitter, adds inter- and intra-round bridges, templates, caps, and occasional long spines to impose color coupling, and updates the working set T.
- **Performance**: Generates 1904 intervals with a competitive_ratio around 1.05; the combined score is 0.00, and tests report correctness.
- **Feedback**: Strengths include reproducible results with a small jitter to avoid symmetry and effective local coupling through bridges and caps. Considerations include the complexity from many interacting components (templates, patterns, caps, spines) which increases maintenance/tuning effort and may warrant ablation studies to understand component impact on scalability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 47 - Patch Name hybrid_wavecaps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Rotating Multi-Scale Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: The core is construct_intervals, a deterministic, multi-phase interval builder. It initializes with a small seed set, uses four interval templates (A–D), and a rotating-start scheme to place blocks. Each round clones and translates the seed blocks, inserts bridges, places scaled gadget templates, injects micro-gadgets, and adds sparse tower-like overlaps, then updates the seed for the next round. A final fine-scale phase scales the whole construction down and repeats a compact 3-wave pattern with bridges and cap-couplers, returning the final interval list.
- **Performance**: The run reports a competitive_ratio around 1.06 with 3165 intervals generated, indicating strong FF-approximation behavior while maintaining a substantial interval count. The coordinates become large due to repeated delta-based scaling, suggesting sensitivity to round count and scale parameters.
- **Feedback**: The design is solid for deterministic, reproducible interval generation with layered scales and varied topologies per round, achieving good competitive performance. However, the large number of intervals and floating-point coordinate magnitudes may impact runtime and numerical stability; tuning parameters (rounds, bridge sizes, and fine-scale factors) could reduce blowup while preserving accuracy.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 48 - Patch Name ff_pressure_rotating_multiscale - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic rotating multi-round interval builder**
- **Implementation**: Builds an initial compact core of four open intervals, then iteratively expands via four rotation templates and a deterministic sequence of start-patterns. Each round translates and optionally reverses the current block set, adds light bridges, global gadget blocks, a micro-gadget inside the middle block, and sparse caps; delta scaling normalizes across rounds, and the result becomes the input for the next round.
- **Performance**: Competitive_ratio 1.07; 1887 intervals generated; combined score reported as 0.00 (the run is deemed correct and passes validation tests).
- **Feedback**: The design uses deterministic knobs (seed_lo, seed_scale) and cyclized pattern templates to ensure reproducible, layered interval growth while attempting to limit omega through scaling and targeted gadgets; the approach yields a large interval set with clear structural phases, but may be computationally heavy for higher rounds and could benefit from tunable round/template parameters to control interval count.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 49 - Patch Name rotating_starts_template_bank_sparse_caps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Implements a six-round process that expands the current interval set T by translating four start-pattern blocks and interleaving them to maximize cross-block overlap. It then appends dynamic connectors (caps and crosses) based on the chosen starts, updates T, and finishes with a micro-phase that sprinkles sparse long-range caps before returning the final interval list.
- **Performance**: Performance achieves a competitive ratio of 2.22 with 9558 intervals and a combined score of 2.00, and the implementation passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: Strengths include diversified start-pattern cycling to avoid periodic reuse and explicit connectors to boost overlap, yielding a robust, deterministic construction. The evaluation confirms correctness, but the large interval count may impact memory/time and could be a target for scalability optimizations.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 50 - Patch Name interleave_blocks - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Gadget Generator**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of intervals by iteratively composing a base spine of four unit intervals with multiple gadget templates and start patterns. Each round scales and translates blocks using delta, alternates inner block order, adds thin bridges between starts, embeds a core gadget and a micro-gadget anchored in the middle, and finally appends two sparse cap families before feeding the result into the next round; the run_experiment function simply returns the constructed interval list.
- **Performance**: Produces 643 intervals with a competitive_ratio of 1.20 and a combined score of 0.00, illustrating a dense but structured sequence intended to stress FirstFit while keeping clique growth controlled.
- **Feedback**: The approach is implemented to vary block order, embed gadgets, and scale components to influence color usage in FF tests; evaluation notes indicate correctness and passing validation tests, though the design relies on many hard-coded constants and pattern choices that could benefit from parameterization or justification for reproducibility.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 51 - Patch Name rotated_spine_templates - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hybrid two-phase recursive interval construction**
- **Implementation**: Builds an initial spine of four unit intervals, then performs Phase 1 with five depth expansions using predefined start patterns and connector templates to generate four scaled copies per iteration (with optional reversal of order), followed by Phase 2 with three mini-wave expansions that inject short interval waves and two cross-connectors per round. The final interval list is returned as floats. run_experiment simply invokes construct_intervals.
- **Performance**: The run yields a very large interval set (about 349,482 intervals) with coordinates in the hundreds of millions, achieving a competitive ratio around 1.07 but reporting a combined score of 0.00 in the provided metrics.
- **Feedback**: The evaluation flags the program as incorrect and not passing validation tests; potential issues include mismatches with the evaluator’s expected constraints or output format, possible data corruption in the reported metrics (truncated/corrupted log line), and brittleness from handcrafted patterns (pattern banks and modular indexing) that may not guarantee required invariants or robustness across test harnesses.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 29 - Patch Name hybrid_wave_expansion - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Adaptive Rotated Four-Block Interval Emitter**
- **Implementation**: Builds rounds of four translated blocks from a small seed interval, applying deterministic start patterns with optional rotation, parity-based reversal, and round-robin interleaving. It adaptively caps depth to respect max_intervals, adds deterministic connectors between blocks, optionally injects a micro-phase of sparse long-range caps, and normalizes/clips coordinates to non-negative integers.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.60; competitive ratio 1.78; intervals produced: 9,560.
- **Feedback**: Validation confirms correctness and passes tests; design choices (rotation, interleaving, and connectors) promote color mixing and interval spread while the adaptive depth cap guarantees budget adherence. Micro-phase adds sparse long-range caps without violating the cap, and normalization ensures non-negative, well-formed intervals.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 52 - Patch Name enable_rotation_and_micro - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic rotated four-block KT-style expansion**
- **Implementation**: A deterministic expansion that maintains a current interval set T and, per round, creates four translated copies (with optional reversal parity), interleaves them round-robin, and appends four connectors derived from the chosen starts; an optional micro-phase can sparsely add long-range intervals.
- **Performance**: Generates roughly 9.5k intervals for 6 rounds (near the intended cap), with output being deterministic and near the target interval count.
- **Feedback**: The combination of rotation, interleaving, and parity reversal effectively disrupts overlap patterns and enhances coverage; connectors enforce color-chaining, and phase2_iters offers a tunable, sparse augmentation at some cost to count. Overall, the approach provides a controllable, repeatable construction with clear trade-offs between density and pattern diversity.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 53 - Patch Name enable_interleave_and_defaults - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adaptive Kierstead–Trotter Block Expansion**
- **Implementation**: Maintains a dynamic set T of open intervals and expands it in rounds by translating four blocks drawn from a deterministic start-pattern bank, computing delta from current bounds to levy translations, and then forming a new set S. It applies optional rotation, parity reversal, and round-robin interleaving to mix colors, adds a deterministic connector set, optionally runs a micro-phase that injects long-range caps with a two-phase mini-expansion, and finally normalizes coordinates and clips to max_intervals.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 1.20; competitive_ratio: 1.71; max_intervals: 9800; produced 9800 intervals as exemplified by the long coordinates listed.
- **Feedback**: The adaptive depth cap enforces a hard bound on the total number of intervals by incrementally growing size with a 7x growth plus connectors and stopping when the next expansion would exceed max_intervals. The rotation, reversal, and interleaving strategies promote color mixing and avoid large cliques, while the micro-phase adds sparse long-range caps, but coordinates can become very large and the approach is sensitive to parameter settings, impacting downstream usage.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 54 - Patch Name two_phase_micro_expansion - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Multi-Block Interval Crossover**
- **Implementation**: Builds intervals via seeds and multiple start-pattern templates, then expands rounds by translating and optionally reversing blocks, interleaving in round-robin order, and appending lightweight blockers plus deterministic connectors. Depth is adaptively chosen to fit a max_intervals cap; a micro-phase can sprinkle long-range caps; final normalization ensures non-negative, positive-length intervals and a final cap.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.40, competitive_ratio 1.56; produced 5803 intervals under a 9800-cap, with correct validation.
- **Feedback**: The method is fully deterministic with clear, modular heuristics (rotation, interleaving, blockers, connectors) that reliably pressure FirstFit while keeping clique growth in check. It relies on fixed templates and depth heuristics; consider parameterizing or documenting choices for portability and potential optimization.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 55 - Patch Name ff_kierstead_crossover - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT Fixed-Start Interval Evolve (FF Pressure)**
- **Implementation**: The function construct_intervals builds an expanding sequence T of open intervals by iteratively translating a base pattern using four fixed starts (2, 6, 10, 14), concatenating translated blocks, and appending four delta-based connectors (left cap, right cap, cross 1, cross 2) before repeating for six rounds; this follows the classic KT construction to maximize FirstFit pressure.
- **Performance**: The run reports a combined score of 1.90 with competitive_ratio 2.71, using 9556 intervals in total.
- **Feedback**: The approach sticks to a deterministic fixed-start KT construction (no micro-phase), yielding a large interval set and moderate competitive ratio; while correct and validated, it trades simplicity for higher interval count, suggesting potential gains from experimenting with micro-phase or alternative starts.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 56 - Patch Name classic_fixed_starts_no_interleave - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Interleaved Multi-Scale Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Generates multi-round, deterministic interval sequences by building per-round blocks from rotating start patterns, translating cloned base 4-interval seeds, interleaving blocks in round-robin order, and appending bridges, rotating template gadgets, a micro-gadget, and tiered towers with varying layers and spans; a second phase adds finer-scale coupling with a smaller delta. All behavior is controlled by knobs (rounds, bridge_fraction, caps_per_round, micro_scale, interleave_blocks) to ensure reproducible, experiment-driven variation.
- **Performance**: Produces 1317 intervals with competitive_ratio 1.00; overall evaluation score shown as 0.00 and validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: The deterministic interleaving and multi-scale layering effectively increase overlap among active colors and density, enabling reproducible experiments across rounds; the approach is parameter-rich but complex, which aids experimentation while challenging readability and maintenance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 57 - Patch Name interleaved_rotating_multiscale - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Recursive Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Seeds four disjoint unit intervals to form an initial spine, then iteratively expands via rounds that rotate among deterministic 4-start patterns and a bank of 4-interval templates. Each round translates and optionally reverses inner blocks, inserts short bridges and caps, conditionally interleaves blocks, and finally appends a small micro-phase; the result is a list of open intervals (l, r) in presentation order.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 1.10; competitive_ratio: 1.10; num_intervals: 469.
- **Feedback**: The design yields deterministic yet varied geometry through round-wise block ordering and inner-order flips, with interleaving and a micro-phase to diversify color interactions; evaluation confirms correctness and validation tests pass, though performance is governed by the implemented strategy rather than runtime optimization.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 58 - Patch Name rotate_template_seed_caps_phase2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Sequence Constructor**
- **Implementation**: Seeds four disjoint unit intervals and iteratively builds translated copies using cycling start-patterns and a per-round template bank. It introduces light bridges, 4-interval connectors, sparse caps, and occasional long spines to diversify color coupling while updating the working set T each round.
- **Performance**: Competitive_ratio 1.06 with 1908 total intervals; the run reports alg: 19 and opt: 18, indicating a stable yet heavy interval construction process.
- **Feedback**: The approach effectively diversifies patterns to disrupt regular FirstFit coloring while keeping the clique number small; the deterministic seeds and layered gadgets yield reproducible results, though the interval count grows substantially and may affect runtime.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 59 - Patch Name rotation_sequence_and_long_spines - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Rotating Multiscale Wave Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Implements rotating multiscale construction: seeds T, per-round translation/scaling using start patterns and templates, interleaving blocks with bridges and micro gadgets, plus a phase-2 refinement and final normalization. Returns a list of open intervals (l, r) in presentation order for FirstFit.
- **Performance**: Generates 1071 intervals with a 9000-interval cap under defaults; deterministic behavior.
- **Feedback**: Deterministic and validation-friendly, producing a dense, multi-scale interval set with many colors. The safety cap and normalization help bound output, though the construction can be computationally intensive as rounds increase.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 60 - Patch Name rotating_multiscale_wave - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Greedy Adversary for First-Fit Interval Coloring**
- **Implementation**: Uses a deterministic, event-sweep max_overlap for the optimum bound, and a naive O(n^2) first-fit color assignment to compute FF. It builds a seed of overlapping cliques, then greedily extends the sequence under an OPT cap by generating a deterministic candidate pool anchored to endpoints and a grid, selecting candidates to maximize the FF/OPT ratio with strict acceptance criteria.
- **Performance**: Competitive ratio observed around 1.40 with about 100 intervals and a combined score near 0.70.
- **Feedback**: The approach yields reproducible adversarial sequences and keeps OPT under a fixed threshold, but relies on quadratic coloring and heavy candidate evaluation, which limits scalability. Potential improvements include faster overlap counting, more scalable candidate generation, and exploring broader candidate diversity.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 61 - Patch Name adaptive_firstfit_adversary - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adversarial FirstFit interval sequence generator**
- **Implementation**: Seeds initial intervals and builds a multi-round, pattern-driven block system using pattern_bank and template_bank; supports rotation, parity-based block reversal, interleaving, and connectors, with a two-phase micro filler and an optional phase-2 sprinkling step; ends with non-negative integer normalization, deduplication, and a hard cap on total intervals.
- **Performance**: Combined objective score is 0.0, and the evaluator reports the program as incorrect and failing validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The implementation is highly intricate with many interdependent parameters, which increases risk of edge-case failures (e.g., cap handling, rounding, deduplication collapsing distinct intervals); kwargs are ignored by run_experiment, reducing flexibility and reproducibility across tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 62 - Patch Name ff_adversary_v2 - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Kierstead-style Interval Constructor**
- **Implementation**: Two-phase interval construction builds an initial seed set, expands via four translated copies of the current block with deterministic interleaving and rotations, then augments with rotated templates, blockers, and connectors; a second, smaller-scale phase and an optional micro-phase sprinkle long-range caps before final normalization and capping to max_intervals.
- **Performance**: Produces up to 9800 intervals; evaluation reports competitive_ratio of 1.08 with a combined score of 0.00.
- **Feedback**: The approach is deterministic and parameterizable, using structured phases (phase I, phase II, micro-phase) to diversify color interactions; clear strengths are reproducibility and explicit cap/layout controls, though the phase-2 block generation and interleaving logic are somewhat intricate and could benefit from simplification or more explicit invariants for maintainability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 63 - Patch Name evolved_kierstead_multiphase - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Fractal Multi-Scale Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Seeds a four-unit open interval spine and, across rounds, translates copies of the current interval set by delta-based offsets to form multi-wave blocks. Adds gadget intervals and bridging intervals between blocks, then normalizes to non-negative integers, rounds endpoints to integers, and caps the total at 10k intervals.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.00; competitive_ratio 1.43; num_intervals 1571.
- **Feedback**: Deterministic, multi-wave construction promotes color diversity while keeping omega small; the approach yields a large but bounded interval set, with potential sensitivity to rounding and offset choices that could affect scalability in higher rounds.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 64 - Patch Name fractal_wave_colorizer - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds a long sequence of open intervals by six iterative rounds. It starts with T = [(0,1)], computes delta = hi - lo, then generates translated copies of T using a set of start_patterns, sometimes reversing the base sequence to disrupt reuse. It adds short bridges between consecutive starts, four connectors (left cap, right cap, cross 1, cross 2), a spine interval across the round, and tiny endcaps near each start, then repeats with T updated to the newly built S. All coordinates are scaled and offset by delta and start pattern values, yielding a large set of intervals (roughly 20k).
- **Performance**: The run yields about 20,476 intervals with a competitive_ratio around 1.16, but the overall combined score is 0.00 and the evaluation reports the program as incorrect and not passing all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The implementation relies on reversed blocks to disrupt reuse and a dense combination of translated blocks, bridges, and caps, which inflates interval count and complexity. A potential correctness issue is that reversing T can produce intervals with left > right (l > r) if not carefully guarded, yet there is no explicit validation enforcing l < r. The reported results (high interval count, nonzero competition metrics, but failing tests) indicate fundamental correctness and/or semantic issues with interval ordering or the objective alignment. Possible improvements include adding explicit interval validity checks, reducing redundancy, and aligning the construction with the validation criteria.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 65 - Patch Name bridges_spine_and_parity - Correct Program: False

- **Implementation**: Deterministic interval construction seeded with four disjoint unit intervals; iterates over rounds using a bank of offset patterns, translating and optionally reversing blocks to form a multi-block structure. Interleaves translated blocks with a rotation scheme, appends a fixed gadget shape, adds bridges (consecutive and skip-one), builds staggered towers, and inserts a micro-gadget inside the median block. Normalizes to non-negative integers, rounds endpoints to integers, enforces ri > li, and caps the total number of intervals at 10,000.
- **Performance**: Achieves a competitive but modestly sized interval set (approximately 2158 intervals) with a competitive_ratio around 1.10 and a reported combined score of 0.00; interval values scale with delta per round, yielding large coordinate ranges (up to tens of thousands) while keeping omega constrained by design choices.
- **Feedback**: The approach is deterministic, reproducible, and passes validation tests, effectively mixing blocks and pressure points to challenge FirstFit while keeping the clique number modest. The implementation uses a rich set of structural augmentations (gadgets, bridges, towers) to drive color pressure, though the resulting coordinates can become large and the interval count must be bounded to ensure tractability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 66 - Patch Name rotating_offsets_towers_micro - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Multiscale Interval Builder with Connectors**
- **Implementation**: The code constructs open intervals through a two-phase deterministic process: Phase 0 seeds a 4-interval spine and Phase 1 expands with multiple deterministic start blocks and 4-interval templates, using Kierstead–Trotter style connectors, scaled template connectors, interleaving blocks, and short interior bridges; Phase 2 adds micro delta gadgets near fixed micro-states and sparse caps, followed by nonnegative normalization and final trimming.
- **Performance**: Achieves 8,870 intervals under a 9,200 cap with a competitive_ratio of 1.22 (combined score 0.00).
- **Feedback**: The deterministic banks and phased construction yield reproducible schedules with controlled omega growth, but the approach relies on numerous heuristics and hard-coded constants; consider parameterizing tunables (scales, bridge fractions, micro-states) and clarifying trimming behavior for robustness and maintainability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 67 - Patch Name delta_bank_two_phase_ff_pressure - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Rotated four-block KT interval expander**
- **Implementation**: Deterministic 4-block KT-style expansion with adaptive depth cap, seeded starts, rotation/interleaving, and a two-phase micro expansion. It seeds initial disjoint unit intervals, adaptively caps depth to max_intervals, and iteratively builds translated blocks with optional reversal to mix colors, followed by connectors; a micro-phase adds fine-scale growth and a fallback if micro rounds are not performed.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 1.50 with competitive_ratio 1.67, producing 5463 intervals (sample intervals show large coordinate spans) under the evaluation budget.
- **Feedback**: The design uses deterministic patterns with rotation, reversal, and interleaving to enhance color mixing and avoid easy periodic reuse, and an adaptive depth cap prevents exceeding max_intervals. Micro-phase adds multi-scale coupling but may be skipped if budget tight; overall, it maintains non-negative normalization and budget adherence while delivering a substantial set of intervals.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 68 - Patch Name two_phase_seeded_rotation - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Delta-wave Interval Evolver with Template Cycling**
- **Implementation**: Deterministic interval generator that builds a seed set T of unit intervals arranged in seed chains, then iteratively expands blocks using an 8-pattern template_bank (with optional rotation) across rounds. It applies per-block micro-shifts, local blockers, and connectors to shape color occupancy, supports an optional second phase with smaller-scale blocks, and a micro-phase that inserts long-range caps; finally it normalizes endpoints to non-negative integers and clamps to max_intervals.
- **Performance**: Achieves the configured max_intervals (9800) with deterministic FF-order intervals; combined score 0.90 and competitive_ratio 1.00.
- **Feedback**: The design yields reproducible, richly interleaved intervals via template cycling and two-phase expansion, but the implementation is dense and relies on numerous arithmetic transforms which may hinder readability and maintainability; edge-case handling and clearer documentation could improve robustness.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 69 - Patch Name delta_wave_evolver - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-style Multi-Start Interval Constructor**
- **Implementation**: Builds intervals by iterative rounds starting from multiple seeds, cycling through start-pattern banks, optionally reversing block parity, and interleaving translated blocks; adds KT-style connectors and neighbor links, plus a micro-phase of sparse long-range caps; normalizes coordinates, rounds to integers, and caps the total to max_intervals with an adaptive depth calculation.
- **Performance**: In the test run, it produced 6,495 intervals with a competitive_ratio of 1.25 (sample intervals shown) and a final combined score of 0.00.
- **Feedback**: The design effectively promotes cross-block coupling and color mixing via seeds, rotation, interleaving, and caps while respecting the interval budget; the implementation is correct and passes validation tests, though the generated sequence is complex and could be tuned further for tighter performance metrics.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 70 - Patch Name two_phase_interleaved_kt_expansion - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block FirstFit Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: Builds a long sequence of open intervals using a fixed start-pattern (starts = (2,6,10,14)) and a 6-round translation/packing scheme. Each round derives translated blocks from the current interval set T, interleaves on even rounds and appends sequentially on odd rounds, then adds four connector intervals. After the rounds, it adds two "cap" intervals near the span to boost later FirstFit color usage. The function returns the final list T of intervals (as (l, r) pairs, with a micro-phase adding small-cap floats).
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.10; competitive ratio 2.33 with 9,558 intervals generated (example endpoints shown in the run). The implementation adheres to the described construction and reports algorithmic metrics (alg: 21; opt: 9).
- **Feedback**: The approach faithfully implements the referenced graph-interval construction and the micro-phase cap addition to influence color usage. It handles nonzero span safety (delta fallback to 1) and uses floats for precise cap positioning, but float-based caps can introduce precision considerations; overall, the validation indicates correctness and the intended performance characteristics.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 71 - Patch Name interleave_even_rounds_and_add_micro_caps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Safeguarded KT Spine Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: A deterministic KT-style spine with a hard CAP guard (CAP=9800) that seeds with (0,1), expands via rounds by translating four spine-start blocks and four connectors, then applies a guarded micro-step phase that adds sparse long caps. Optional features are present but disabled in safeguarded mode, and depth is computed to stay under CAP.
- **Performance**: Produces 9558 intervals under CAP with a combined score of 2.00 and a competitive ratio of 2.50; the result is validated as correct and deterministic.
- **Feedback**: The safeguarded design preserves the strong baseline KT spine while preventing overgrowth, using a conservative micro-step phase to avoid densifying the core; evaluation shows solid performance within the safety constraints and confirms deterministic behavior.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 72 - Patch Name kt_spine_delta2_cycle - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Multi-scale Rotating-Template Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Deterministic, multi‑stage interval construction seeded with disjoint blocks; it rotates through 4‑block start patterns, clones blocks with optional reversals, inserts 4‑interval gadgets, adds micro‑gadgets and a micro‑phase, then normalizes to non‑negative coordinates and truncates to max_intervals.
- **Performance**: Empirically targets 9800 intervals with competitive_ratio ≈ 1.12, and validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: The approach yields a reproducible, highly structured interval set via layered templates; however, its reliance on numerous hard-coded templates and floating-point calculations may limit flexibility and formal guarantees.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 73 - Patch Name none - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adversarial Interval Sequence Evolver for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds an adversarial, deterministic interval sequence by seedting with structured cliques, then greedily extending via a candidate pool generated from endpoints, midpoints, and a grid. It uses max_overlap to compute the clique size (OPT) and a naive O(n^2) first-fit color assignment to obtain FF, with tight cap on final OPT (<= 10). Intervals are treated openly in overlap checks, but counting uses [l, r) convention for determinism. Final intervals are normalized to non-negative coordinates and rounded.

- **Performance**: In evaluation, the approach reports a combined score of 0.70 with roughly 100 intervals and a competitive ratio around 1.4 (FF/OPT ≈ 1.4), employing up to ~400 candidate evaluations per extension and O(n^2) coloring per trial, which can be computationally intensive.

- **Feedback**: The method is highly deterministic and tuned to push FF relative to OPT by exploring structured candidate placements and densest-overlap regions, but it can be sensitive to local optima and scaling (heavy, non-parallel computation). The strict OPT cap and seed structure help constrain growth, though lack of randomness may limit exploration; performance hinges on the efficiency of repeated overlap/color computations and candidate evaluation.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 74 - Patch Name densest_point_candidates - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Multiscale Interval Builder for FF**
- **Implementation**: A two-phase, deterministic interval constructor with a budget cap. It runs 6 main rounds using eight starter templates and parity-based interleaving plus four connectors, then optionally a micro-phase (2 rounds) that samples from the current set and adds micro-blocks and connectors. All intervals are translated from a seed T, with a hard MAX_TOTAL of 9800, plus a final tiny-cap sprinkle to bind colors lightly.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.90; competitive_ratio 1.12; intervals produced: 9800 within the budget cap.
- **Feedback**: The approach yields deterministic, budget-constrained exploration that stresses the FirstFit behavior while keeping the clique number small; the structured templates and interleaving promote diverse interactions and reproducibility, though reliance on fixed constants/templates may limit adaptability across different budgets or inputs. Validation indicates correctness and budget adherence.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 75 - Patch Name multiscale_delta2_tower - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Two-Phase Interval Expander for FirstFit Optimization**
- **Implementation**: Seeds with four unit intervals, then iteratively expands using eight start patterns and four connector templates. The expand_phase function builds translated blocks (sometimes flipped), interleaves them with a forward/reverse scheme, appends gadget connectors, and adds short caps. A micro-phase can append three tiny intervals. Final normalization shifts to non-negative integers and caps at max_intervals (9800). Depth splits into a primary 4-round phase and a secondary half-scale phase, with an optional micro-phase at the end.
- **Performance**: Evaluation reports Combined score 1.00 and competitive_ratio 1.00, producing exactly 9800 intervals; intervals span large coordinate ranges (millions), indicating scalable, reproducible generation due to deterministic seeds.
- **Feedback**: The modular, pattern-driven expansion effectively targets a FirstFit/omega objective and yields stable, high-quality results under the given constraints. However, reliance on handcrafted patterns may limit adaptability; potential improvements include parameterizing patterns/templates or optimizing for memory/time with streaming generation.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 76 - Patch Name modular_two_phase - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Evolve-Block Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Builds a low-omega spine of four disjoint unit intervals, then iteratively expands via a deterministic bank of start-pattern templates across rounds. Each round translates and parity-flips blocks, interleaves them deterministically, attaches connectors (caps) to couple colors, and applies a micro-phase using a delta2 scale to create cross-scale ties. The process is constrained by a hard MAX_INTERVALS cap (9800), with pattern density trimmed when approaching the budget, followed by normalization to non-negative integers and ensuring open intervals.
- **Performance**: The evaluator reported a competitive_ratio around 1.05 with 3875 intervals produced (subject to the large, offset coordinates after normalization); the run remains within the 9800-cap, though coordinates can become large due to repeated translations and scaling.
- **Feedback**: The approach uses layered, deterministic transformations (start bank, parity interleaving, caps, and delta2 micro-expansion) to generate diverse interval interactions while maintaining tractability. Strengths include predictable growth control and rich cross-block coupling; risks include substantial coordinate magnitudes and complex constants that may hinder readability and sensitivity to round/count changes.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 77 - Patch Name ff_spine_multiphase_bank - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT Interval Construction for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds a KT-inspired sequence by starting with (0,1) and iteratively generating translated “blocks” using starts = (2,6,10,14). Each round selects block sources (T or reversed T) with parity-based reversal, stitches blocks with connectors (left_cap, right_cap, cross1, cross2) in a round-dependent order, updating T each iteration, and finally returns the list of open intervals.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.00; competitive_ratio ~1.43; number of intervals = 9556; algorithm version indicated as alg: 10, opt: 7.
- **Feedback**: The design adheres to a fixed-start KT coupling with parity-based block reversal to disrupt reuse and uses arrival-order connectors to shape FirstFit pressure; evaluation reports a strong but non-optimal competitive ratio and a large interval sequence, with the implementation aligning with the classic construction and passing tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 78 - Patch Name connector_interleaving_blockers - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of open intervals through six rounds, selecting from multiple start-pattern templates, translating and interleaving blocks to maximize cross-block overlap, and attaching dynamic connector intervals (left cap, right cap, cross caps). It caps growth at 9800 intervals and optionally adds a small micro-phase of long-range caps to lightly extend coverage, then returns the interval list.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 1.80 with a competitive ratio of 2.57, using 9556 intervals.
- **Feedback**: The approach leverages pattern variation, interleaving, and connector design to boost color usage under FirstFit while keeping growth bounded; micro-phase adds sparse long caps to further influence overlap. Overall, the implementation is correct and passes validation, though the method remains heuristic with room for tuning patterns and scaling.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 79 - Patch Name extend_start_patterns_and_runtime_cap - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-spine interval synthesis with guarded augmentation**
- **Implementation**: Builds an expanding set of open intervals by phase-wise translation of four-start blocks, optionally reversing parity, and interleaving blocks; enforces a CAP of 9800 intervals, uses a template bank for starts, and stitches blocks with multiple connectors (left/right caps and cross connectors) before proceeding to the next round; phase 2 adds small micro-caps guarded by capacity, followed by normalization to non-negative integers and ri > li guarantees.
- **Performance**: Deterministic output capped at 9800 intervals; evaluation shows competitive_ratio 1.00 with num_intervals = 9800 (score reported as 0.00).
- **Feedback**: The approach reliably bounds growth and yields full-CAP outputs with configurable diversification (rotation, reversal, interleaving); explicit connectors and phase-2 augmentation maintain structure while keeping omega in check. The evaluation data appears extremely large and slightly truncated at the end, suggesting reporting artifacts rather than algorithmic issues; overall, the implementation is robust and deterministic within the CAP constraint.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 80 - Patch Name modular_kt_spine_improved - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Rotated Kierstead–Trotter intervals**
- **Implementation**: Implements adaptive-depth block expansion using four rotated start-patterns, optional block reversal parity, and interleaving. Each round builds four translated blocks, interleaves them (with round-based rotation), injects a Figure 4 gadget scaled by the current delta, adds connectors, then repeats for the next round; a micro-phase adds sparse long-range caps; finally, coordinates are normalized to nonnegative integers and converted to open-interval pairs (li, ri) with minimal length 1, truncated to max_intervals.
- **Performance**: Default configuration yields 3756 intervals (max_intervals cap is 9800) with a competitive_ratio of about 1.47; coordinates scale into the mid-millions (e.g., around 0.9–1.6 million) reflecting the width scaling via delta across rounds.
- **Feedback**: The approach effectively caps growth via adaptive depth and maintains presentation-order intervals through systematic interleaving and gadget insertion; explicit normalization and open-interval representation ensure consistency. The results indicate correctness and acceptable performance under validation tests, though coordinate magnitudes can become large with default scaling.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 81 - Patch Name trotter_crossover - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic KT Spine with Safeguarded Intervals**
- **Implementation**: Builds a KT-style spine up to a CAP of 9800 intervals using four translated copies anchored at spine_starts [2, 6, 10, 14], with optional interleaving and deterministic connectors. Stage 2 adds a micro delta round by sampling a small seed from the current spine and placing four micro-blocks within global span windows, all guarded by capacity checks; phase2_iters is effectively capped to 1 by default.
- **Performance**: Final result yields 9684 intervals under CAP, with metrics: combined score 2.10, competitive_ratio 2.33 (alg:21, opt:9).
- **Feedback**: The safeguarded mode disables several knobs (rotate_starts, reverse_block_parity, interleave_blocks) to preserve baseline strength; the two-stage design achieves substantial growth while maintaining safety, though depth is intrinsically CAP-limited, potentially constraining further refinement.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 82 - Patch Name kt_spine_even_interleave_plus_delta2_micro - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Interleaving Block Interval Generator for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of open intervals by iterating six rounds over pre-defined start patterns, translating and optionally reversing block copies of the current interval set, interleaving blocks round-robin with parity-based reversal, then appending a set of dynamic connectors (left cap, right cap, cross bridges) plus light and sparse second-next bridges. Updates the working set T = S each round and returns the final interval list. Aims to stress FirstFit while keeping the clique number modest through cross-pattern coupling.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.00; competitive_ratio: 1.16; num_intervals: 15835; intervals: [large list of computed interval pairs; evaluation ends with an incomplete trailing line and notes that the program is incorrect and does not pass all validation tests].
- **Feedback**: The approach purposefully interleaves multiple start patterns and adds bridges to couple colors, but the evaluator marks the submission incorrect, indicating validation failures despite a nontrivial interval construction and a nontrivial competitive ratio. Noted concerns include an incomplete/garbled evaluation tail and potential robustness issues in meeting all test constraints.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 83 - Patch Name interleave_reverse_and_bridges - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Deterministic Multi-Round Wave Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Builds open intervals by seeding four unit intervals, then iteratively expanding over rounds using four templates (A–D) and three start-pattern cycles. Each round translates and optionally reverses prior blocks, interleaves them to maximize overlap, adds light bridging and Kierstead–Trotter style connectors, scales templates by a computed delta, and appends sparse caps. After the rounds, a small micro-phase with fixed mid-starts adds extra intervals to force late color usage. The result is a deterministic, parameterized sequence of intervals returned as T.
- **Performance**: Reports a competitive_ratio of ~1.21 with 1895 intervals generated (sampleed intervals shown); initial “combined score” is 0.00, indicating a neutral objective in the given evaluation.
- **Feedback**: The design is a dense, deterministic construction that blends round-based expansion, cross-block interference via interleaving and connectors, and a micro-phase to ensure late-color coverage. Strengths include reproducibility and rich structural patterns; potential improvements include refactoring into smaller functions for readability and providing explicit tests for each construction phase to ease maintenance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 84 - Patch Name two_phase_interleave_connectors - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Classic four-start, six-round interval construction**
- **Implementation**: It computes how many rounds fit under a max interval budget using a 4x+4 recurrence, seeds with a single unit interval, and iteratively builds blocks by translating the current set, then appending four deterministic connectors; starts can be rotated through predefined patterns, and a micro-phase can insert additional caps if fewer than six rounds are possible; finally, it normalizes endpoints to non-negative integers and truncates to the cap.
- **Performance**: On the given run, it produced 9556 intervals within a 9800-interval cap, achieving a combined score of 1.80 and a competitive ratio of 2.57.
- **Feedback**: The approach leverages sequential, non-interleaved block construction with four connectors per round to boost FF pressure under budget, with deterministic start patterns and an optional micro-phase for tuning; results are sensitive to parameter choices and endpoint magnitudes can become large despite the interval cap.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 85 - Patch Name ff_spine_6round_classic - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Fractal KT-inspired Interleaved Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Implements a fractal KT-inspired interval builder using four-start block patterns that are translates of a base interval, with optional reversal per block parity and round-dependent interleaving. It adds deterministic connectors, optionally sprinkls a micro-phase at the end, and finally normalizes endpoints to non-negative integers.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.10; competitive_ratio ~1.83; intervals generated: 152.
- **Feedback**: Deterministic toggles (rotate_starts, reverse_block_parity, interleave_blocks, micro_phase) and a fixed MAX_INTERVALS cap govern depth and distribution, yielding scalable yet budget-bound performance; depth limitation and start-pattern choices critically shape interval spread and overlap.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 86 - Patch Name fractal_kT_improved - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adaptive Kierstead–Trotter interval block expander**
- **Implementation**: Seeds a single unit interval and builds four translated blocks per round using deterministic start patterns (with optional rotation, reversal, and interleaving). It uses an adaptive depth cap based on max_intervals, adds deterministic connectors to propagate colors, optionally sprinkles a micro-phase, then normalizes and truncates to non-negative, integer intervals.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.80 with 9556 intervals and competitive_ratio ~2.57 under the budget.
- **Feedback**: The adaptive depth mechanism respects the interval budget and yields reproducible, structured interval sets; enabling interleaving, rotation, or micro-phase can noticeably alter color distribution and interval spacing, offering knobs to trade off density and spread. Consider exploring those flags to tune performance for specific workloads.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 87 - Patch Name classic_four_block_six_rounds - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Fractal KT-inspired Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Builds a seed interval and iteratively expands it by creating four translated copies of the current set (with optional reversal), interleaving the copies in a round-dependent order, and appending deterministic connectors to form new intervals. It then normalizes endpoints to non-negative integers, enforces a minimum width of 1, optionally sprinkles a micro-phase at the end, and runs two extra post-round phases, all under a MAX_INTERVALS cap to bound growth.
- **Performance**: Score around 1.50 with a competitive_ratio near 1.88, generating about 2.4k intervals in the provided run.
- **Feedback**: The design is deterministic yet tunable via toggles (rotate_starts, interleave, reverse parity) to diversify layouts; micro-phase and extra rounds improve coverage but add complexity and heavier outputs, suggesting careful tuning of MAX_INTERVALS and depth for different goals.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 88 - Patch Name enhanced_two_phase_wave_expansion - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Four-Start Recursive Interval Construction with Connectors**
- **Implementation**: Implements a deterministic four-start, six-round recursive block builder. Each round translates four copies of the current interval set by a delta derived from the current span, concatenates them (optionally interleaved), and appends four connectors to couple blocks while keeping the clique number bounded; a final micro-phase, normalization, and cap are applied.
- **Performance**: With max_intervals=9800 and depth=6, it yields 9560 intervals (including a small micro-phase) and reports a competitive density under cap; the run demonstrates stable, deterministic behavior with a fixed pattern cycle.
- **Feedback**: The modular design (rotation of starts, interleaving option, micro-phase) provides controllable trade-offs between density and structure; the approach faithfully preserves open-interval pressure while respecting budget, though coordinates can grow large and rely on normalization to non-negative integers.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 89 - Patch Name crossed_beta_interior_ff - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hybrid rotated-interleaved Kierstead–Trotter construction**
- **Implementation**: Deterministically expands intervals across depth rounds, starting from [(0,1)], forming four translated copies per round with optional reversal parity and rotated start patterns. It interleaves blocks to stress FirstFit, adds deterministic connectors, and may sprinkle a micro-phase cap; a safety cap and depth adjustment keep total intervals under 9800.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.10; competitive_ratio 1.83; produced 152 intervals.
- **Feedback**: Deterministic design with cycle-based pattern variation reduces periodicity; depth-adaptive cap prevents blow-up; validated as correct and passes all validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 90 - Patch Name adaptive-extra-rounds KT-press_diff - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic KT Spine with Safeguarded Two-Phase Scaffold**
- **Implementation**: Builds a KT-style spine by iteratively expanding a base interval list T into four translated copies per round (using fixed spine_starts) plus four connectors, then optionally adds a wave phase by interleaving four translated copies of the spine and a guarded micro-step phase; a CAP of 10000 is intended to cap growth, with a two-phase safeguard and an adaptive_waves block that can dramatically increase the count if not properly restrained.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.20; competitive_ratio 2.75; num_intervals 38228; the produced intervals exceed CAP, indicating the safeguarding does not reliably enforce the limit during adaptive waves.
- **Feedback**: The safeguarded design overshoots capacity due to the adaptive_wave stage (interleaving four large translated blocks) being executed before cap enforcement, triggering an early return with far more than CAP intervals; to repair, cap enforcement should be applied during or before wave generation (e.g., prune/truncate S2 or gate adaptive expansion more aggressively).
**Program Identifier:** Generation 91 - Patch Name adaptive_wave_post_spine - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Four-Block Interleaved Interval Constructor**
- **Implementation**: Seeds four disjoint unit intervals, then iteratively expands via four translated blocks per round using a computed delta, optionally interleaves blocks, appends exactly four connectors, and finally normalizes to non-negative integer endpoints within a cap; an optional micro-phase can sprinkle extra intervals, all under a rounds-budget computed by _rounds_allowed_under_cap.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.80, competitive_ratio 2.25; 5464 intervals produced under the budget, with validation confirming correctness.
- **Feedback**: The approach yields deterministic, budget-controlled growth with modular helpers and toggleable features (rotation, interleaving, micro-phase) and passes all validation tests; results depend on fixed start patterns and cap parameters, offering predictable performance but coupling tightly to the chosen budget settings.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 92 - Patch Name adaptive_wave6 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Rotated Four-Block Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Builds intervals via iterative rounds, translating four copies of the current set using rotating start offsets, optionally reversing every odd block, and then appending deterministic connectors (left cap, right cap, cross connectors, plus an extra cross). A phase-2 micro-phase optionally sprinkles small intervals. Returns the final list of open intervals in the computed order.
- **Performance**: Defaults yield around ten thousand intervals (e.g., 10931) with competitive_ratio ~1.16, but Combined score remains 0.00, indicating poor scoring despite large output.
- **Feedback**: The evaluator notes the program is incorrect and does not pass all validation tests; despite extensive interval generation, the implementation likely violates required invariants or ordering constraints (FF presentation) expected by validation, suggesting misalignment with problem specifications.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 93 - Patch Name add_cross3_and_enable_rotation - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: A heuristic that builds a sequence of open intervals by iteratively translating and interleaving blocks derived from the previous set T. It cycles through predefined start-pattern templates, translates each block by a delta equal to the current span, interleaves the translated blocks, appends connectors, and repeats for six rounds. After the rounds, it adds two long-range caps near the ends and returns the final interval list T as (l, r) pairs (treated as open-interval semantics conceptually).
- **Performance**: Evaluation reports a competitive_ratio of 1.53 with about 10,923 intervals produced, but the overall combined score to maximize is 0.00, and the final output trace appears truncated or corrupted, indicating validation failure.
- **Feedback**: The approach relies on a brittle interleaving scheme and fixed templates; validation indicates the implementation does not satisfy all tests (outputs appear malformed or inconsistent, and the final message notes incorrectness). Improvements should include formalizing interval validity checks, ensuring deterministic and well-formed outputs, and providing targeted tests for the FirstFit color-ratio objective.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 94 - Patch Name interleave_templates_extra_caps - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: KT-spine interval expansion with blockers**
- **Implementation**: Implements KT-inspired rounds that build per-round blocks from rotated start_patterns, insert tiny blockers, clone and optionally reverse the prior interval sequence, and interleave or concatenate blocks to form the next sequence with four connectors appended. It uses a depth bound to cap rounds by cap and optionally runs a micro-round to raise FF pressure without significant omega growth.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.30; competitive_ratio 1.44 with up to 9800 intervals (cap).
- **Feedback**: The design leverages rotating start patterns and interleaving to reduce periodic reuse and adds a micro-round to perturb the state while keeping omega small, but it relies on heuristic parameter choices without formal guarantees; careful tuning of blockers, gaps, and cap-related guards is critical for performance and stability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 95 - Patch Name kt_spine_crossover - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Four-Start Six-Round Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Implements a four-start, six-round recursive interval construction. It computes the maximum feasible rounds under a cap using a linear recurrence, then iteratively expands by translating the previous block set, appends four fixed connectors per round, and optionally adds a phase-2 delta-coupled layer and a micro-phase; finally, it normalizes endpoints to non-negative integers and enforces the interval cap.
- **Performance**: Achieves the budgeted 9800 intervals with a competitive_ratio around 1.06, indicating effective packing within the limit.
- **Feedback**: Deterministic start patterns and sequential block expansion boost targeted pressure (FF) within the cap; phase-2 delta coupling and (when needed) micro-phase tweaks provide additional First-Fit pressure without large omega growth, while careful normalization/capping ensures valid outputs.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 96 - Patch Name phase2_delta_coupling - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block FirstFit Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: Builds a long sequence of open intervals by starting from a seed set T (default single unit interval, or multiple unit intervals if seed_count > 1), then iteratively forming translated “blocks” using a fixed start pattern (2, 6, 10, 14). Each round interleaves or concatenates these blocks, adds four connectors based on the current delta (span) of T, and updates T to the new sequence. A micro-phase appends three long-range caps (computed from fractional positions of the current span) to boost late FirstFit color usage while controlling omega. Intervals are represented as (l, r) with open endpoints, and the function returns the final list after six rounds plus caps. The approach follows a fixed KT-coupled construction from the referenced paper and uses a deterministic, parameterizable seeding strategy.
  
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 2.10 with a competitive ratio of 2.33, using 9,559 intervals (example output provided). The produced interval set is large and highly structured, with coordinates growing into the millions, reflecting the deliberate scaling strategy for the FirstFit behavior.

- **Feedback**: The implementation choices (fixed start pattern, round-by-round translation, and explicit connectors) encode a known construction to force FirstFit to use more colors relative to omega. The separation into rounds (even interleaving vs odd sequential) and the post-hoc micro-phase caps are effective for increasing color usage in practice, but they yield a large number of intervals and big coordinate values. Allowing seed_count > 1 provides a means to diversify input instances, though this still results in deterministic, verbose constructions. Overall, the approach is self-contained and validates the intended performance characteristics, but could be tuned to reduce interval count or coordinate scale if needed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 97 - Patch Name seeded_multi_seed_and_enhanced_microcaps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Rotated four-block Kierstead–Trotter interval generator**
- **Implementation**: Deterministic expansion builds four translated blocks per round, with starts rotated across rounds, optional parity-based reversal, and round-robin interleaving to maximize interval pressure; connectors (caps) are added to couple blocks without forming large cliques, followed by a non-negative normalization and optional micro-phase sprinkling before final truncation.
- **Performance**: With default settings (max_intervals=9800, depth=6), it produced about 9556 intervals and achieved a competitive_ratio around 1.86 (score ~1.30).
- **Feedback**: The implementation cleanly separates rounds calculation, block construction, and interleaving, enabling tunable geometry via rotation/interleave/phase options; deterministic design aids reproducibility, though deeper parameter sensitivity analysis or simplifications could improve efficiency for different caps.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 98 - Patch Name ff_cross_rotblocks_cap_final - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Rotated Kierstead–Trotter Intervals**
- **Implementation**: Implements a deterministic four-pattern Kierstead–Trotter–style interval expansion with an adaptive depth cap to fit under max_intervals. It maintains a list T of open intervals, expands by translating four copies of T using a delta derived from the current span, and appends four KT-style connectors; optional features include rotate_starts, reverse_block_parity, interleave_blocks, and micro_phase, followed by normalization and CAP trimming.
- **Performance**: Performance shows a combined score of 1.80 with a competitive_ratio of 2.57, producing 9,556 intervals within an 9,800-cap budget.
- **Feedback**: Strengths include preventing blow-up via adaptive depth and explicit CAP guards, plus pattern options (rotation, interleaving) that diversify interval placement. Potential improvements could explore stochastic or adaptive start selection to reduce determinism-driven symmetry and further tuning of micro_phase interactions with the CAP.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 99 - Patch Name kt_spine_guarded_micro - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Fractal KT-inspired interval block construction**
- **Implementation**: Builds a seed interval and iteratively creates four translated blocks from deterministic start patterns, optionally reversing parity and interleaving blocks. It appends four deterministic connectors per round (caps and crosses), optionally sprinkles a micro-phase at the end, then adds a delta2-extension. Endpoints are normalized to non-negative integers via rounding with a guaranteed positive span, all under a MAX_INTERVALS cap to bound growth.
- **Performance**: Produces 9,565 intervals within an 9,800-interval budget, with a competitive_ratio of 2.00 in the given run.
- **Feedback**: The approach yields a deterministic, fractal-like interval layout with reproducible results and explicit budget controls; enabling interleaving or micro-phase toggles offers knobs for shape variation, while the current configuration prioritizes stability (EXTRA_ROUNDS disabled). Overall, the implementation passes validation and produces consistent interval sets.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 100 - Patch Name six_rounds_sequential_delta2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Interleaved Interval Generator for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds chained blocks by translating a seed interval set using a bank of start patterns and a growing delta, with alternating interleave directions and rotation to diversify overlaps. It appends connectors and micro-caps to promote cross-scale coupling, then runs a multi-round construction (plus a final micro-phase) until a CAP threshold is approached.
- **Performance**: Reported result includes 12,286 intervals (num_intervals) with a competitive_ratio of 1.46, contradicting the intended cap (< 10000) and indicating the approach does not meet validation constraints.
- **Feedback**: The implementation fails validation tests by exceeding the stated interval cap and producing an overly large interval set; the CAP-based guard is inconsistently applied across branches, and the final micro-phase can push totals beyond the limit, signaling brittle bounds handling and ad-hoc interleaving choices.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 101 - Patch Name delta_coupled_spine_v2 - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: KT-style interval spine with rotating starts**
- **Implementation**: Deterministic KT-like spine builder seeded with (0,1); adaptive depth limited by CAP via round growth (4*size+4). Each KT round translates four blocks derived from four start patterns, optionally reversing parity per block, and either interleaves or concatenates blocks. Connectors are derived from the first four starts, and a micro-phase can append sparse caps near the end. Final normalization shifts to non-negative coordinates, enforces strict interval length, and caps output at CAP.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.80; competitive_ratio 2.57; yields 9556 intervals under the default CAP (9800). The approach is parameterizable (rotate_starts, interleave_blocks, micro_phase) and produces a large, structured set of open intervals suitable for FirstFit.
- **Feedback**: Strengths include deterministic, scalable interval generation with controllable symmetry and spacing (via reverse_block_parity and interleave options). The micro-phase and rotation help diversify late intervals without dense cliques. Ensure the produced interval values stay within practical bounds for downstream consumption, as numbers can be quite large due to block translations.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 102 - Patch Name kt_spine_optimizer_v2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Four-Block Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: Seeds four disjoint unit intervals and, for each allowed round, builds four translated copies of the current set, optionally interleaving the blocks, then appends four fixed connectors to couple across blocks; start patterns rotate and a final micro-phase plus normalization cap endpoints to fit max_intervals.
- **Performance**: With the default cap of 9800, it outputs 5464 intervals and reports a combined score of 1.80 with a competitive ratio of 2.25.
- **Feedback**: The approach is correct and passes validation tests; deterministic four-pattern starts with rotation and interleaving plus connectors effectively manage budget while expanding structure. The produced intervals are predominantly unit-length endpoints under the cap, suggesting potential gains from exploring longer blocks or alternative micro-phase tuning to reduce interval count while preserving constraints.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 103 - Patch Name one_more_round_if_budget_allows - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-inspired fractal block-assembly interval generator**
- **Implementation**: Iteratively builds four translated copies of the current interval set, interleaving them per round, adds deterministic connectors, and optionally sprinkling a micro-phase and a second, subscale depth-extension before normalizing to non-negative integer endpoints.
- **Performance**: Scores 1.20 overall with a competitive_ratio of 1.71, producing 612 intervals (example set shown).
- **Feedback**: The approach is deterministic and parameterized by simple toggles (rotate_starts, reverse_parity, interleave), yielding controlled growth and reproducible results; micro-phase and extra-depth rounds improve depth and variety but introduce notable complexity and potential brittleness in tuning.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 104 - Patch Name delta2_extension_rounds - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-style interval spine micro-phase**
- **Implementation**: Deterministic KT-style spine builder that maintains a sequence of intervals T, applies round-based translations from four preset start patterns (with optional rotation), interleaves or concatenates blocks, and appends classic connectors. It adaptively caps depth to respect a maximum CAP, optionally interleaves blocks, and can append a micro-phase near the end; finally it normalizes to non-negative integers and enforces a CAP-sized output.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.70; competitive_ratio ~1.75; CAP limited to 9800 intervals.
- **Feedback**: The approach effectively bounds output size and provides spacing diversification via rotation and interleaving, while the micro-phase helps influence late-fit without dense cliques. The added complexity from multiple options (rotation, interleaving, micro-phase) improves flexibility but requires careful normalization and boundary handling.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 105 - Patch Name default_enable_interleaving_and_microphase - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic KT-style spine with safeguarded phases**
- **Implementation**: The core function construct_intervals builds a KT-like spine under a strict capacity guard (CAP = 9560). It seeds with (0, 1), computes depth via a KT growth function (round_next_size(sz) = 4*sz + 4) capped by CAP, and iteratively translates four anchor blocks per start [2,6,10,14] with optional interleaving disabled in the safeguarded mode; deterministic connectors are appended to preserve FF pressure. A guarded phase-2 micro-round can be run (phase2_iters) but is typically limited to at most one micro-round and only if space remains, generating four small windowed blocks plus connectors and trimming to budget.
- **Performance**: Produces 9,556 intervals under CAP constraints, with a combined score of 1.90 and competitive_ratio of 2.71; the explicit interval list is included in the run result, and the implementation reports alg: 19, opt: 7.
- **Feedback**: The design emphasizes safety and determinism: interleaving and micro-phase toggles are effectively disabled to control omega growth, while a capacity-guarded second phase provides a conservative path for minor enrichment. Validation notes indicate correctness and successful test passage, though configurability is intentionally limited to safeguard growth.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 106 - Patch Name disable_interleave_and_microphase_guard - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block FirstFit Interval Builder**  
- **Implementation**: Maintains a evolving set T of open intervals, constructs translated copies in blocks using a fixed start pattern (2, 6, 10, 14), and alternates interleaving/sequencing across six rounds. Appends boundary-cap connectors derived from the current span, then assigns S to T for the next round; a second phase adds three small inner caps. Supports optional seeding with multiple disjoint unit intervals via seed_count, by initializing T accordingly. Returns the final list T of open intervals.  
- **Performance**: Reported metrics: combined score 2.00, competitive ratio 2.22, with 9,559 intervals generated. The evaluator provides a concrete interval list illustrating substantial growth.  
- **Feedback**: The deterministic block-translation design with alternating interleave/concat rounds plus cap connectors yields a sizeable interval sequence and a modest competitive ratio; the seed_count option adds flexibility to pre-seed the construction, increasing interval count and diversity. The implementation aligns with validation expectations, producing correct results within the provided evaluation framework.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 107 - Patch Name phase2_micro_caps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Rotated four-block Kierstead–Trotter interval builder**
- **Implementation**: Implements a deterministic, four-block expansion with per-round translations, interleaving, and connectors to push First-Fit pressure under a cap. It uses _rounds_allowed_under_cap to bound rounds, builds translated blocks with _build_rotated_blocks, interleaves them via _interleave_blocks (with optional adaptive parity), attaches deterministic connectors, and normalizes endpoints to non-negative integers.
- **Performance**: Achieves 9556 intervals under a 9800 cap (competitive_ratio ~1.86) with a combined score of 1.30, using deterministic patterns and rotation to maximize interval count while controlling omega.
- **Feedback**: The approach is reproducible and tunable (rotation, interleaving, micro-phase, extra rounds) to amplify FF pressure without breaking the cap; the fixed-start patterns and deterministic connectors provide predictable behavior, though the strategy relies on preset patterns rather than dynamic optimization.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 108 - Patch Name improve_ff_with_delta2_and_adaptive_interleave - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Spine plus Micro-Extension Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Constructs intervals in two stages: six deterministic spine rounds (translated blocks plus connectors) around a fixed spine_starts template, followed by two micro-extension rounds that sample a thin seed, translate blocks at half-scale, and interleave them deterministically with parity-based reversals and additional connectors. A capacity guard (CAP = 9800) bounds the total number of intervals, and run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals with the default seed handling.
- **Performance**: Competitive ratio 2.20 achieved with 9,676 intervals (below the 9,800 cap); the output reflects a fully deterministic construction (alg: 22, opt: 10).
- **Feedback**: The staged spine plus micro-extension design yields a high interval count while controlling omega through seed sparsity and capped growth; deterministic interleaving and symmetry-breaking twists help explore FF pressure without exceeding capacity. Potential improvements include simplifying the interleaving logic, parameterizing stage counts and caps, and reducing memory churn for very large interval lists.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 109 - Patch Name multiscale_kt_spine_plus_delta2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-inspired Block-Fractal Interval Constructor**
- **Implementation**: Normalizes input intervals to non-negative ints with positive span, then builds a fractal-like sequence by repeatedly expanding a base interval using four translated, possibly reversed blocks derived from a set of deterministic start patterns. Interleaving across blocks is round-dependent; each round adds four deterministic connectors, followed by optional micro-phase augmentation at the end. A hard MAX_INTERVALS budget caps growth, and a final normalization converts to integers. A second run_experiment wrapper exists (the later definition ignores kwargs), shadowing the earlier one.
- **Performance**: Score around 2.10 with a competitive_ratio ~2.33; about 9,560 intervals generated (closed under MAX_INTERVALS budget).
- **Feedback**: The design provides deterministic, budget-aware interval construction with modular components (normalization, blocks, interleave, connectors, micro-phase) that effectively boost First-Fit pressure while controlling omega usage. The approach relies on several hard-coded heuristics and toggles, and the duplicate run_experiment definition could cause confusion or override behavior in different contexts.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 110 - Patch Name six_round_sequential_boost - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-inspired Fractal Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: A deterministic, multi-stage interval generator using 8 start templates, seed T = [(0,1)], and four helper routines (_normalize_to_int_intervals, _append_micro_phase, _make_blocks, _interleave_blocks). It builds blocks from transformed copies of T, interleaves them per round with optional reversal/rotation toggles, adds deterministic connectors (caps/crosses), then optionally sprinkles micro-intervals and runs two extra post-round phases before final normalization to non-negative integers.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.40; competitive ratio 1.75; 2452 intervals generated (sample shown); configuration: alg: 14, opt: 8.
- **Feedback**: The approach yields reproducible, fractal-like interval sets with diverse cross-scale structure via deterministic toggles and template rotations. The depth cap and normalization ensure feasibility, while micro-phase and extra rounds boost long-cap coverage, though at the cost of growth in interval count. Overall, the implementation passes validation tests and provides a robust, rule-based interval-generation strategy.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 111 - Patch Name eight_template_block_bank - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-Style Spine and Micro-Round Interval Evolve**
- **Implementation**: A deterministic two-stage construction builds open intervals for FirstFit optimization. Stage 1 creates a KT-style spine via six translation rounds with fixed connectors, seeded by [(0,1)], and stops when a 9800-interval CAP would be exceeded; Stage 2 adds three micro-rounds that sample from the current set, apply a delta2 scale, rotate start templates, interleave blocks with parity, and add connectors, ladders, and sparse fringe caps while still honoring the CAP.
- **Performance**: Competitive_ratio 1.85; num_intervals 9733 under CAP, with final intervals listing and validation showing the algorithm passes tests.
- **Feedback**: The approach uses deterministic, symmetry-breaking interleaving and careful capacity guards to push FirstFit pressure while controlling omega; high interval count is achieved near CAP, but the method remains fully deterministic with potential room for exploration of seeds, budgets, or stochastic variations to probe further improvements.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 112 - Patch Name parity_cadence_three_micro_rounds - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block adversarial FF interval construction**
- **Implementation**: Implements a multi-round adversarial construction for FirstFit using a fixed 4-block start pattern (2, 6, 10, 14). Each round translates and optionally reverses copies of the current set T into blocks, interleaves or concatenates them by round parity, adds four connector intervals, and then uses the result as the new T; after six rounds, a micro-phase ladder of four overlapping intervals is appended to push color counts while keeping the micro-clique small.
- **Performance**: The run yields a combined score of 1.60 with a competitive ratio of 1.78, generating 9,560 intervals.
- **Feedback**: The design leverages fixed starts and oriented block construction to control overlap structure and maximize FirstFit colors; the ladder phase enforces specific partial overlaps (I1∩I3 ∅, I2∩I4 ∅) to sustain pressure on FF with a small clique, and the approach is validated as correct by tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 113 - Patch Name ladder_microphase_and_block_reversal - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Safeguarded KT-spine interval generator**
- **Implementation**: Builds a deterministic KT-style spine seeded with (0,1), using four fixed starts [2,6,10,14] and four translated blocks per round, plus connectors; cap-based safety (CAP = 9800) governs depth; main phase uses non-interleaved rounds to control omega, with a dormant template_bank and optional micro Phase-2 that adds thin seeds and parity-driven interleaving, all returning FF open intervals in generation order.
- **Performance**: Score 2.20 with 9676 intervals produced under the safety cap.
- **Feedback**: The two-phase safeguarded design effectively increases interval count while bounding growth; deterministic translations and strict CAP gating keep omega in check, though Phase-2 parameters (budget, interleaving) could be tuned further to squeeze additional performance without violating safety.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 114 - Patch Name micro_parity_cross3 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Rotated-block Kierstead–Trotter interval expansion**
- **Implementation**: Starts from a single unit interval and iteratively builds four translated copies per round using a rotating template_bank of starts, optional reversal for parity, and round-robin interleaving to mix blocks. After constructing translated blocks, four deterministic connectors are appended, forming the next round’s interval set; an optional second micro-phase can extend the set but relies on an undefined CAP constant.
- **Performance**: Intended to produce on the order of ~9556 intervals with 6 rounds (configurable), but risk of runtime failure exists due to an undefined CAP and phase2 handling; overall growth is exponential in rounds, increasing memory usage and compute time significantly.
- **Feedback**: The implementation harbors a critical bug (CAP is not defined in the excerpt) that will cause runtime errors when phase2_iters > 0, undermining correctness tests. The default phase2_iters value and the micro-phase logic can unexpectedly inflate results or fail constraints unless CAP is defined and bounds are properly managed.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 115 - Patch Name template_bank_expansion_start_patterns - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: KT-inspired Fractal Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Builds intervals iteratively from a starting unit interval, using four translated blocks per round driven by deterministic start-patterns and optional rotation. It interleaves blocks (configurable), adds neighbor bridges and deterministic connectors, sprinkling a micro-phase at the end, then normalizes to non-negative integers with a tight MAX_INTERVALS cap (9800).
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.40; competitive_ratio 1.56; 9,800 intervals generated.
- **Feedback**: The approach uses deterministic, budget-bounded block assembly with micro-phase augmentation to distribute intervals and pressure FirstFit, but relies on fixed patterns and toggles, which may limit generalization and adaptability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 116 - Patch Name neighbor_bridges_and_depth_cap - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-style spine with micro-extensions (evolve-block)**  
- **Implementation**: Builds intervals via a deterministic KT-inspired spine using an 8-pattern template bank, starting from a single unit interval, then expands in rounds with a global CAP (9800). It interleaves translated blocks, inserts spine blockers, adds connectors, and then performs a two-stage micro-extension phase (delta2 scaling, four micro-blocks per round, optional tight delta2', and extra long caps), all under capacity guards. A phase2_iters parameter exists but is not utilized.  
- **Performance**: Reported metrics show a very large interval set (around 15k intervals) with competitive_ratio ~1.54, but the results contradict the intended capacity guard (CAP) and the evaluator marks the program as incorrect/not passing tests.  
- **Feedback**: The capacity management is brittle and inconsistent (interval count exceeds CAP; early-break and remaining-budget logic can overshoot). The code relies on many magic numbers and lacks usage of phase2_iters, making validation fragile. Improvements should enforce strict bounding of total intervals, remove unused parameters, and clarify/document the heuristics for micro-round budgets and blocker placement.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 118 - Patch Name kt_spine_evolver_v2 - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Four-start six-round interval construction**

- **Implementation**: Implements a 4x + 4 recurrence to grow color-block intervals starting from a single unit interval. It computes the maximum feasible number of rounds under a cap, seeds with [(0,1)], and in each allowed round translates four blocks (optionally rotating start templates and reversing odd blocks), then appends four deterministic connectors. A micro-phase can insert extra small caps if fewer than six rounds were possible. Endpoints are normalized to non-negative integers and truncated to the cap.

- **Performance**: Achieves near-budget interval usage (9556 of 9800) with a high FF/omega objective, reporting a combined score of 1.90 and competitive_ratio of 2.71.

- **Feedback**: The implementation is correct and passes all validations; it deterministically saturates the budget when possible and uses configurable block ordering and parity to influence FF pressure. Micro-phase behavior is conditional and only used when rounds < 6, ensuring stability once six rounds fit.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 119 - Patch Name fixed_spine_with_parity_blocks - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction for FirstFit**

- **Implementation**: The code builds a sequence of open intervals by repeatedly transforming the current set T of intervals through translated blocks, interleaving them, and appending connector caps. It cycles through predefined start-pattern templates over six rounds, using delta = hi - lo to translate blocks, then performs a two-step micro-phase to sprinkle long-range caps, finally returning the accumulated interval list T.

- **Performance**: Evaluation reports a competitive_ratio of about 1.61 with 10,926 intervals generated (alg: 29; opt: 18), and an overall score of 0.00, indicating the approach does not meet validation benchmarks.

- **Feedback**: The method relies on ad-hoc geometric constructions (translations, interleaving, and bespoke caps) to inflate color usage under FirstFit, but the resulting sequence fails validation tests, suggesting brittle design and potential misalignment with the targeted optimization criteria or interval semantics (open intervals vs integer endpoints).
**Program Identifier:** Generation 120 - Patch Name add_cross3_connector - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Six-round four-start FF interval builder**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of open integer intervals by simulating a recurrence size_{k+1} = 4*size_k + 4, seeding with (0,1) and iteratively constructing four translated blocks per round using predefined four-start patterns (rotated or fixed), with optional reversal of odd blocks to disrupt color reuse. It then appends four fixed connectors per round, optionally adds a micro-phase sprinkle, and finally normalizes/truncates to a non-negative cap of intervals.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 1.60 with a competitive ratio of 1.78, producing 9,560 intervals within the 9,800-interval budget.
- **Feedback**: The design favors determinism and reproducibility (fixed start patterns, sequential blocks, and per-round connectors) to boost FF pressure within budget, with a micro-phase that conservatively fine-tunes density when space allows; validation indicates correctness and test success.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 121 - Patch Name rotate_and_always_micro - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: FirstFit adversarial interval construction with KT coupling**
- **Implementation**: Uses a fixed start pattern (2, 6, 10, 14) and seeds with disjoint unit intervals depending on seed_count. It performs 8 rounds of transforming and interleaving translated blocks, then appends cap-style connectors to shape FirstFit behavior, followed by three long-range caps to boost late colors while controlling omega; returns a list of open intervals (l, r) as the constructed instance.
- **Performance**: Competitive ratio ≈ 2.45 with 152,919 intervals; overall combined score reported as 0.00, and validation flags the program as incorrect/not passing all tests.
- **Feedback**: The approach follows a KT-coupled adversarial construction, but the implementation fails validation tests, suggesting mismatches in interval semantics, seed handling, or cap design that prevent meeting the target guarantees or test expectations.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 117 - Patch Name adaptive-kt-rounds-8 - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Four-Start Recursive Interval Construction with Connectors**
- **Implementation**: Constructs intervals by expanding in rounds, each round producing four translated blocks and four connectors. It caps rounds using _rounds_allowed_under_cap, then optionally interleaves blocks, applies reverse parity for alternation, and adds a micro-phase and a booster to extend depth within budget; final intervals are normalized to integers and capped.
- **Performance**: The configuration achieves a combined score of 1.70 (competitive_ratio 1.70) with 9563 intervals generated under the budget.
- **Feedback**: The design uses deterministic four-pattern starts, parity reversal, and optional tuning (interleaving, micro-phase, booster) to control omega while expanding rounds; evaluation indicates correctness and a solid score within the interval cap, though further sensitivity analysis could probe depth decisions and pattern choices.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 122 - Patch Name kt_spine_booster_v1 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic KT Spine with Safeguarded Two-Phase Expansion**
- **Implementation**: Builds a deterministic KT-style interval spine capped by CAP=9800, starting from T=[(0,1)]. Stage 1 expands depth via a KT-round growth 4x+4, using four translated blocks per round and fixed connectors, with rotating start templates to preserve symmetry without increasing omega; Stage 2 adds micro-rounds using a scaled delta2, thin seeds sampled from the current spine, four translated blocks per micro-round, parity-based interleaving, and additional long-range connectors and caps, all guarded to respect CAP; the implementation disables optional dynamic toggles in safeguarded mode for stability.
- **Performance**: Competitive ratio 2.09; 9727 intervals produced under the 9800-cap, with validation tests passing.
- **Feedback**: The design achieves a stable, reproducible expansion with strong capacity guarding and deterministic seeds, balancing FF pressure against omega growth. Opportunities exist to explore parameter variations (e.g., templates, interleave policy) to push density further without compromising safety.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 123 - Patch Name rotating_spine_plus_third_micro - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Safeguarded KT Spine with Micro-Phase Intervals**
- **Implementation**: Deterministic KT-style spine starts from (0,1) and expands in two phases under a strict CAP (9800). Stage 1 builds four translated blocks per round around spine_starts with alternating interleaving, then Stage 2 adds micro-rounds (thin seeds, delta2-based translations, parity-based interleaving, and connectors) constrained by budget guards to stay under CAP; returns open intervals in FF order.
- **Performance**: Competitive ratio 2.00 with 9727 intervals produced under CAP (9800); output validated and produced within the deterministic framework.
- **Feedback**: The two-phase safeguard successfully caps growth while maintaining dense interval coverage; deterministic seeds and interleaving rules yield reproducible results, though the numerous constants and flags could benefit from clearer documentation or tunable parameters.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 124 - Patch Name even_interleave_plus_delta_stacking - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction (Two-Stage)**
- **Implementation**: Constructs a sequence of open real intervals to maximize FirstFit color usage divided by the maximum number of intervals covering a point. Stage 1 uses a deterministic KT-style spine with four translated blocks and classic connectors; Stage 2 adds two delta2-scale micro rounds with thin seeds, interleaving (forward/reverse) across four starts, additional connectors, and sparse caps, all under a CAP guard (9800).
- **Performance**: Competitive ratio 2.20 achieved with 9,676 intervals generated.
- **Feedback**: The two-stage design—deterministic spine followed by micro rounds with interleaving and scale-down—effectively raises FirstFit pressure while bounding omega growth via the CAP guard; validation reports correctness and stability, though the generated sequence is large and approaches the cap.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 125 - Patch Name fixed_spine_plus_two_micro_rounds - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-Style Deterministic Interval Spine with Micro-Phase**  
- **Implementation**: Builds a deterministic spine of open intervals via iterative KT-style rounds. Starts with a tiny seed [(0,1)], computes how many rounds fit within a CAP using round_next_size (4*sz+4), and applies rounds by translating the current spine across four predefined start patterns (A–D). Blocks can be rotated and optionally interleaved; connectors are added to couple blocks. An optional micro-phase adds a small delta2-scale seed and sparse long caps to further pressure FF, with careful normalization to non-negative integers and CAP-bound trimming. The function preserves the original interface and output format (list of (l, r) pairs).  
- **Performance**: Achieves CAP=9800 intervals with a competitive_ratio around 1.23; produced a sizable interval set under the given run (exact intervals shown in results). The implementation includes adaptive depth limiting, rotation/interleaving controls, and a micro-phase that adds targeted seeds without exploding the clique number.  
- **Feedback**: The approach combines deterministic KT-spine construction with configurable complexity knobs (rotate_starts, interleave_blocks, micro_phase) to stress FirstFit. Micro-phase tends to increase FF pressure while remaining bounded, though it introduces additional coordinate arithmetic and potential growth in interval values. Overall, the solution is correct under validation tests and adheres to the expected interface, offering tunable behavior for performance experimentation.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 126 - Patch Name delta2_micro_and_cross4_spine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Spine with Micro-Rounds (FirstFit)**  
- **Implementation**: A two-stage interval construction that starts with a deterministic KT-style spine (6 rounds) using four translated blocks plus connectors, then enriches with delta-driven micro rounds (thin seeds, rotated starts, four blocks per round, and multiple connectors) under a strict capacity guard (CAP = 9800). Stage 1 builds from a seed interval and repeatedly translates/couples existing blocks; Stage 2 adds micro-intervals while enforcing a budget, using even/odd round interleaving and targeted scaling to diversify patterns without exploding omega. The final interval list T is returned; run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals.  
- **Performance**: Competitive ratio ≈ 2.09 with 9723 intervals generated; overall evaluation reports a zero composite score and validation success (algorithm correct and passes tests).  
- **Feedback**: The staged design effectively increases FirstFit pressure while cap-limiting growth to keep omega bounded. The combination of deterministic spine, symmetry-breaking rotations, and micro-round diversification yields a large, diverse interval set without exceeding the guard budget, though coordinates can grow quite large due to translations. The implementation is deterministic and reproducible, with explicit capacity checks and fallback behavior when near CAP.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 127 - Patch Name triple_micro_cross4_rotation - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Spine-Based Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: A two-stage interval generator constructs open intervals via a deterministic spine process (six rounds) using spine_starts (2, 6, 10, 14) and a capacity guard CAP=9560, followed by two micro-extension rounds driven by a delta2 scaling and a thin-seeded sampling of existing intervals, with parity-based interleaving, extra connectors, and sparse caps; the seed starts as a unit interval and the process is capped to ensure termination.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.90; competitive_ratio 2.71; 9556 intervals generated (sample output shown).
- **Feedback**: The implementation cleanly separates spine growth from micro-extensions, enabling controlled growth of the interval set within a fixed capacity while promoting cross-scale coupling; deterministic interleaving and symmetry-breaking measures (parity-based reversals) aid diversification, though results are heavily CAP-bound and tuned for this specific evaluation.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 128 - Patch Name skip_micro_by_cap - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Spine-based FirstFit interval construction**
- **Implementation**: Builds a deterministic 6-round spine by translating four blocks derived from spine_starts (2,6,10,14) around a dynamic delta, interleaving blocks differently on even vs odd rounds, and appending classic Figure-4 style connectors to form T; seeds with (0,1), caps growth at 9800 intervals, and returns the spine-only open intervals to avoid omega inflation.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 1.90 with a competitive ratio of 2.71, producing 9556 intervals (showing large-scale spacing in values like ~1.5–2.18 million).
- **Feedback**: The implementation employs a clear spine-and-connectors design with a capacity guard and a deliberate choice to return spine-only intervals to mitigate micro-phase-induced omega inflation; results indicate scalable yet non-optimal FF/omega performance, with predictable, reproducible behavior across runs.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 129 - Patch Name skip_micro_and_even_interleave - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Spine-Micro Interval Growth**
- **Implementation**: Builds intervals in two stages: (1) a deterministic spine expansion over six rounds using four-start translations and standard connectors under a 9,800-capacity guard, producing a robust baseline; (2) two micro rounds that sample from the spine, apply delta2-scaled, interleaved blocks with additional connectors and sparse long caps, all while respecting the capacity limit.
- **Performance**: Combined score: 2.20; 9,720 intervals generated within the 9,800-cap limit.
- **Feedback**: The staged approach gives a solid baseline early via deterministic spine rounds, then increases FF pressure with carefully controlled micro-extensions (delta2 scaling, interleaving, and connectors). It stays within capacity and yields a respectable score; potential improvements include exploring dynamic CAP/seed_count tuning and alternative micro-round interleavings to push further gains without inflating omega.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 130 - Patch Name increase_cap - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Builder**

- **Implementation**: Constructs intervals by seeding two base blocks, expanding through rounds using predefined templates to generate blocks, then appending five connectors per block; normalization shifts to non-negative coordinates and caps the interval count, while micro-phases sprinkle additional near-edge intervals to broaden color touchpoints. The core flow is: seed T, determine rounds with _rounds_allowed, build per-round blocks via _build_blocks, extend with _append_connectors, apply micro-phases with _micro_phase, then _normalize to final intervals.

- **Performance**: Competitive_ratio ~1.64 with 3759 generated intervals, demonstrating moderate effectiveness within the given cap.

- **Feedback**: The approach combines templated spine growth with connector-based expansion and targeted micro-phases, enabling controlled growth under a cap but still leaving room for improvement in ratio via template/scale tuning or dynamic adjustments; normalization and capping prevent unbounded growth and maintain feasible output.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 131 - Patch Name enhanced_spine_multiscale - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Two-Seed KT-Spine Interval Evolver**
- **Implementation**: The solver constructs intervals in two stages: Stage 1 builds four translated template blocks from a two-seed base T using a rotated KT-spine-like scheme with optional interleaving and cross4 connectors; Stage 2 runs three micro-rounds with delta-based scaling, budget-aware thinning, and parity-driven block reversals, followed by additional connectors and sparse caps, then normalizes to non-negative coordinates and converts to integer intervals capped at CAP=9800.
- **Performance**: Achieved competitive_ratio 1.27 with 4548 intervals produced (within the CAP bound).
- **Feedback**: The template-driven spine plus multi-scale micro rounds effectively diversify interval layouts while enforcing a strict budget, and the normalization/rounding ensures valid non-negative intervals; overall the approach passes validation tests, though the exact distribution could be tuned for improved balance or coverage.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 132 - Patch Name improved_spine_micro - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Spine-Micro Interval Evolve with Interleaving**
- **Implementation**: A two-stage interval builder: Stage 1 builds a deterministic spine via six rounds using four-start templates and static connectors, with a CAP guard to terminate growth. Stage 2 applies micro rounds using thin seeds, delta2 scaling, forward/reverse interleaving, and additional cross-scale connectors and sparse caps, all under the same capacity bound.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 2.20 with a competitive_ratio of 2.20, producing 9722 intervals under CAP (validated as correct and passing tests).
- **Feedback**: The staged spine-plus-micro design effectively amplifies FirstFit pressure while controlling clique growth, yielding reproducible results due to deterministic seeds and templates; CAP-driven termination ensures bounded runtime, though there may be room to optimize interval growth further or exploration of alternative seed strategies.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 133 - Patch Name rotate_spine_templates_and_add_cross4 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Spine KT-Style Intervals for FirstFit**

- **Implementation**: The function construct_intervals builds a KT-style spine of open intervals using a CAP guard (9800). It starts with a seed interval (0,1), then performs up to six rounds where each round rotates one of four templates, translates four blocks accordingly, interleaves blocks (even rounds) or concatenates them (odd rounds), and attaches four connectors (left cap, right cap, cross 1, cross 2). The base for each block is computed from delta = hi - lo, with lo/hi derived from the current spine T. The process updates T and stops if its length exceeds CAP, finally returning the spine-only construction (list of (l, r) pairs). The implementation comments reference Figure 4 style and keeps the final output as a spine to avoid omega inflation from micro-phases.
  
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.90; competitive_ratio ~2.71; number_intervals 9556. The produced intervals span large coordinate ranges, reflecting cumulative translations across rounds.

- **Feedback**: Key design choices—rotating templates and interleaved block assembly—diversify interval interactions to mitigate omega inflation, and returning only the spine avoids micro-phase inflation while preserving theoretical properties. Evaluation indicates correctness and passes tests, though the method yields large coordinate values and relies on specific pattern rotations.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 134 - Patch Name rotating_spine_templates - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Safeguarded KT Spine with Capacity Cap**
- **Implementation**: Builds a deterministic KT-style interval spine starting from (0,1), capped at CAP=9800. Stage 1 grows via a fixed spine pattern with four translated blocks per round and optional interleaving; connectors tie blocks to preserve FF pressure. Stage 2 adds a small micro-round using a sparsely sampled seed from the spine and four narrow windows within the global span, all guarded by the same capacity cap and limited to at most two iterations. The function run_experiment returns the generated interval list.
- **Performance**: The algorithm reaches the capacity cap (9800 intervals) with a competitive_ratio of 1.71; the full interval set is produced and reported in the results.
- **Feedback**: The two-stage, capacity-bounded design yields predictable, deterministic output and stable performance, with a tunable but limited exploration path (template bank and phase-2 micro rounds). Safety gating ensures scalable behavior but reduces configurability and potential gains from more aggressive exploration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 135 - Patch Name diversified_spine_and_micro_enhancement - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of open intervals by rotating through a bank of start patterns, translating and concatenating prior blocks, interleaving on even rounds and stacking on odd rounds, then appends five fixed connectors per round and a final Phase-2 cap pass; seeds with either a single unit interval or multiple unit intervals based on seed_count, returning the final interval list.
- **Performance**: Achieved a competitive ratio of about 1.73 with 10,924 intervals, but the overall run reports a Combined score of 0.00 (algorithm vs. optimal metrics show poor guidance from the objective).
- **Feedback**: The implementation is incorrect and fails validation tests; while it follows a patterned construction (inspired by a figure from literature), it does not meet the evaluation criteria and produces suboptimal/invalid results, suggesting misalignment with the expected objective function or constraints.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 136 - Patch Name rotate_start_patterns - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Four-Start, Six-Round Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: Builds a deterministic four-start, six-round interval set by iteratively translating four blocks of the current interval set, offset by a computed delta. Each round appends four fixed connectors, and the final round may add long-range connectors; optional interleaving, parity-based block reversal, and a micro-phase extension refine the structure. Endpoints are normalized to non-negative integers and capped to max_intervals.
- **Performance**: Produces about 9.5k intervals (example run shows 9562) with a competitive ratio around 1.55; the construction is parameterizable (rotate_starts, reverse_block_parity, interleave_blocks, micro_phase) and bounded by a cap via _rounds_allowed_under_cap.
- **Feedback**: The approach is a compact, parameterizable constructive method with clear modular steps (block translation, connectors, normalization). It yields valid interval sets within a budget and exposes useful knobs (rotation, interleaving, micro-phase) to explore trade-offs, though it relies on floating offsets in connectors that are reconciled by final integer normalization. Overall, it is deterministic, test-friendly, and scalable within the budget constraints.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 137 - Patch Name parity_reverse_plus_cross4 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Kierstead–Trotter Block Expansion with Rotation**
- **Implementation**: Implements a recursive block-expansion scheme that computes rounds under a max budget, builds four translated blocks per round with optional block reversal, interleaves blocks (concatenation or round-robin with per-round order rotation), adds four Kierstead–Trotter connectors, and applies a micro-phase near the end; endpoints are normalized to nonnegative integers and clamped to the budget.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.60 with competitive_ratio 1.78; 9563 intervals generated within the 9800-interval budget.
- **Feedback**: The rotating start patterns and optional reversal diversify geometry and reduce pattern repetition, while connectors and micro-phase boost density near the end; overall behavior remains within budget and passes validation, though results produce large-endpoint intervals and rely on floating-to-integer rounding for final normalization.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 138 - Patch Name improved_kt_crossover - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Safeguarded KT-Spine with Micro-Round Augmentation**
- **Implementation**: A deterministic KT-style spine capped by CAP (9800) intervals, built in two phases: a stage-1 KT spine expansion with four translated blocks and fixed connectors, followed by a constrained micro-round stage that samples a thin seed from the current spine, expands with delta2-based translations, adds long-range connectors, and enforces a strict budget to stay under CAP.
- **Performance**: Achieves 1.60 score with 9731 intervals under the capacity guard (CAP) and a corresponding competitive_ratio of 1.60.
- **Feedback**: The two-phase design effectively yields a dense, deterministic interval set while maintaining safety via CAP and staged growth; the micro-phase provides additional coupling without blowing up memory footprints. The implementation is somewhat intricate (multiple translation, interleaving, and connector rules) and could benefit from simplification or more explicit parameterization to ease maintainability and tuning. The tests report correctness and validation success.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 139 - Patch Name spine_rotation_parity_and_third_micro - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Multi-Phase Interval Constructor**

- **Implementation**: Builds up to 9800 open intervals via a three-phase strategy: Phase 1 constructs a KT-style spine using rotated templates and alternating K values, applying a translate-and-connect operation to grow the interval set; Phase 2 performs micro-rounds with thinning, parity-reversed block construction, and extras to diversify connections; Phase 3 adds a small set of final sparse caps to fill to CAP. The code uses dynamic bounds (lo/hi), delta scaling, and per-phase adjustments to generate a deterministic, large interval set without external dependencies.

- **Performance**: Evaluation reports a combined score of 1.90, competitive ratio 2.71, producing exactly 9800 intervals (example output shown), and passes all validation tests.

- **Feedback**: The approach leverages phased, structured expansion (spine + micro-rounds + caps) to systematically cover the interval space while keeping output bounded. Parity-based block ordering and extra connectors in Phase 2 improve diversity; the final cap stage guarantees precise output size. The method is deterministic and parameter-driven, but relies on carefully chosen constants (templates, starts, deltas) to achieve the reported metrics.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 140 - Patch Name improved_spine_micro3 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Rotating KT Spine with Micro-Phase**
- **Implementation**: Builds an open-interval spine by seeding with (0,1) and repeatedly applying KT-round growth up to a capacity CAP=9800, using a rotating template_bank to translate four blocks per round with a fixed delta and inserting connectors; a guarded micro-phase (phase2_iters up to 2) can append small micro-blocks derived from a spine seed when near CAP. The design disables optional toggles (rotate_starts, reverse_block_parity, interleave_blocks) in safeguarded mode and performs stage 1 with do_interleave=False before optionally enabling a bounded stage-2 micro-round.
- **Performance**: Score metrics show a combined score of 2.30 and competitive ratio of 2.30, producing exactly 9,800 intervals.
- **Feedback**: The approach is deterministic and safety-gated, achieving the target interval count under CAP while balancing growth through a two-stage spine plus micro-phase; effective for preventing omega blow-up, though defaults emphasize safety over broader exploration.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 141 - Patch Name rotate_and_micro_unlocked - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block FirstFit Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Builds a long sequence of open intervals by rotating a small four-start template bank across six spine rounds, with an occasional spine multiplier K for cross-scale coupling. It translates and interleaves blocks derived from the current interval set, adds deterministic connectors (cross3/cross4), and then runs two micro-round passes (delta2 and delta3) that generate additional small blocks via thin sampling. A final set of caps keeps the total under a CAP (9800). The algorithm uses deterministic reversals and round-robin template selection to diversify color interactions, and returns the final interval list T.
- **Performance**: Evaluation reports a competitive_ratio of 1.32 with 12,286 intervals produced, which exceeds the configured CAP of 9800 in the code, and overall a zero combined score, indicating the implementation does not satisfy validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The approach is overly complex and brittle relative to the target objective, with a CAP violation in outputs and inconsistent interval magnitudes (large, scattered values). To pass tests, it needs CAP-enforcement guarantees, simpler semantics aligned with FirstFit goals, and thorough unit Tests around end-to-end interval counts and overlap properties.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 142 - Patch Name spine_bank_delta3_micro_rounds - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block FirstFit Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: The algorithm builds a sequence of open intervals by performing six KT-style rounds using a four-pattern template bank to translate a seed interval set T; in each round blocks are formed from translations, interleaved on even rounds or concatenated on odd rounds, then four connectors are appended. It then runs two micro-phases (A and B) that insert long-range caps and sparse micro-blocks to boost FirstFit color usage, all guarded by CAP = 9800 to keep the total count in check.
- **Performance**: Score 2.30 (competitive_ratio 2.30) with 9687 intervals generated; intervals occupy large, scaled coordinates (e.g., around 813k to 1.4M), reflecting a dense but bounded construction.
- **Feedback**: The design yields reproducible, parameterizable growth in FirstFit colors while controlling omega via the CAP cap and targeted micro-augmentations; potential improvements could explore additional seed patterns or template variations to push the ratio further without increasing resource usage.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 143 - Patch Name rotating_spine_plus_delta2_micro - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Multi-Phase Interval Generator for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: A three-phase heuristic builds 9800 open intervals. Phase 1 creates a spine-like layout using four translation templates and alternating K multipliers to expand intervals; Phase 2 forms micro-rounds with rotated, paritied blocks and tiny blockers plus adaptive connectors; Phase 3 adds final sparse caps to reach the target count. The process relies on lo/hi, delta, and various translations to generate diverse interval placements.
- **Performance**: Produces 9800 intervals with a reported combined score of 1.90 and competitive ratio of 2.71.
- **Feedback**: Validation tests pass; the approach uses handcrafted, parameter-rich scheduling (templates, rotations, extras) to induce FirstFit pressure. While effective, the method is heuristic and sensitive to the chosen parameters, with float-based blockers introducing minor precision considerations.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 144 - Patch Name micro_round_adaptive_and_call_fix - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Deterministic Sequential Open-Intervals**
- **Implementation**: Builds four translated copies of a base interval set T per round using a fixed 4-template spine and a base offset computed from delta and lo. It appends four connectors (left cap, right cap, and two cross relations) each round, optionally adding a long-range cross on the final round, and finishes with a small, late tail to boost FirstFit performance while keeping capacity bound (CAP = 9800). Seed handling enforces reproducible initialization and caps seeds to four when multiple seeds are requested.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 2.20 with a competitive ratio of 2.20, producing 9,561 intervals under the CAP constraint.
- **Feedback**: The deterministic, round-robin 4-template spine plus connectors yields reproducible results and targets FirstFit color pressure; the final-round cross and micro-tail are pragmatic tweaks to improve late-stage performance without blowing omega or capacity. The implementation is straightforward and test-passing, though opportunities exist to explore alternative seeds, spacing, or dynamic K values for potential gains.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 145 - Patch Name quad_spine_rr_microtail - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-style Interval Construction for FirstFit**  
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of open intervals by 6 deterministic rounds, translating a seed set T across a fixed template (starts = (2,6,10,14)) and interleaving block orders to intensify FirstFit pressure. Each round reverses every other translated block, then appends four connectors, updating T for the next round; seeds can be a single unit interval or multiple disjoint unit intervals, with a hard cap of 9800 total intervals to stay under 10000; micro phases are disabled. The function run_experiment() simply returns the constructed interval list.  
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.30, competitive ratio 1.86 with 9556 intervals generated (example output given), and validation reports the program as correct and passing tests.  
- **Feedback**: The approach achieves substantial FirstFit pressure while controlling clique size via a cap and interleaving strategy; note that, despite comments about rotating start templates, the implementation consistently uses only the first template (2,6,10,14). Potential improvements include enabling actual template rotation and selectively re-enabling micro phases to explore tradeoffs between FF and OPT.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 146 - Patch Name spine_seq_no_micro - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-inspired Fractal Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Constructs four translated blocks per round from the current interval set using predefined start patterns, interleaves blocks on alternating rounds, and appends standard connectors with an optional long-range cross4 on the final round; a micro-phase can sprinkle extra intervals. It normalizes endpoints to nonnegative integers, enforces a hard budget MAX_INTERVALS (9800), and derives depth via a growth bound, with optional two_seed and add_cross4 toggles to influence seed layout and long-range connections.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 1.60; competitive_ratio: 1.60; about 9.5k intervals generated (9561).
- **Feedback**: The approach is deterministic and budget-conscious, using modular helpers for blocks, connectors, and micro-phase; evaluation notes indicate correctness and validation tests pass, with potential room to explore runtimes beyond the 9800-interval cap and to clarify parameter semantics.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 147 - Patch Name spine_multiplier_and_cross4_connectors - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic KT-style spine with rotating templates**
- **Implementation**: Builds a KT-like interval spine by repeatedly translating a growing seed list T using four strong-start templates (rotated across rounds), with parity-based interleaving and optional reversal. It enforces a hard capacity cap (CAP=9800), appends classic connectors, and then adds a micro-phase tail of long caps followed by up to two micro-rounds that generate windowed, delta-driven blocks with deterministic connectors.
- **Performance**: Achieves 9687 intervals under CAP with a combined score of 2.30 and a competitive_ratio of 2.30.
- **Feedback**: The approach effectively blends deterministic spine construction with micro-phase augmentation to boost interval count while remaining bounded; however, it relies on several hard-coded constants (CAP, templates, window/fraction choices) and could benefit from parameterization and additional tests to ensure stability across inputs and seeds.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 148 - Patch Name rotating_kt_spine_plus_microtail - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Open Interval Synthesizer**
- **Implementation**: The algorithm translates a seed interval set T into four translated blocks using bases derived from delta and lo (base = s * delta * K - lo). It supports sequential or interleaved block packing, appends four connectors (left cap, right cap, cross1, cross2) with an optional final long-range cross4, and then applies a micro-round phase with windowed seeds plus a tiny tail of long caps, all bounded by CAP = 9800 to cap growth.
- **Performance**: Performance reports a competitive_ratio of 1.92 with about 9,689 intervals, kept under the 9800-cap, indicating the interleaving and micro-round strategies effectively manage growth while maintaining schedule diversity.
- **Feedback**: The design uses parity-based interleaving to disrupt low-color reuse and a micro δ-round to spread seeds across four windows, followed by a tail insertion to boost late-Fast-Fail activity without omega inflation; potential improvements include exploring alternative K scaling, window placements, seed sets, and connector strategies for further gains.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 149 - Patch Name parity_interleave_plus_delta2_micro - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Two-Stage KT-Style Spine Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: Stage 1 builds a sequential KT-style spine by translating copies of the current interval list across four fixed spine starts (2, 6, 10, 14) with alternating internal order per round and appends four connectors in Figure-4 style; this loop is guarded by CAP=9800 and RESERVE=200 to leave room for a micro-phase. Stage 2 adds a micro-round at half-scale: it samples a small set U from the current spine via thin_seed, translates four micro blocks, interleaves their blocks to mix colors, and adds deterministic connectors plus sparse micro caps, constrained by a budget (up to 200) to fill remaining capacity.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 1.60; competitive_ratio: 1.60; num_intervals: 9663.
- **Feedback**: The approach yields correct results and passes tests, producing a large, deterministic interval set that attains the targeted ratio; the explicit CAP and micro-phase ensure feasibility and stability, though the code is complex and could benefit from simplification and clearer documentation.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 150 - Patch Name sequential_spine_plus_guarded_micro - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Safeguarded KT Spine Micro-Phase**

- **Implementation**: A deterministic KT-style spine with a strict capacity guard (CAP = 9800). Stage 1 builds four translated blocks from spine_starts [2, 6, 10, 14] around a seed interval, using non-interleaved rounds and fixed connectors. Stage 2 optionally adds a thin, micro-phase of translated blocks (four-start templates, rotated starts, and parity-based reversals) with predictive budgets and deterministic connectors, all limited by CAP. The function returns the final interval list T.

- **Performance**: Produces 9679 intervals with a competitive_ratio of 2.09; alg: 23, opt: 11; all results stay within CAP constraints and validation tests pass.

- **Feedback**: The design combines a strong, stable KT spine with a safeguarded two-phase extension to raise FF pressure while containing omega growth. The safeguarded mode disables some options (rotation, parity interleaving) in Stage 1, ensuring determinism and safety; Stage 2 introduces micro-extensions under strict budgets. This yields reproducible results but may limit exploration; future tweaks could adjust micro-budgeting or start-template diversity for potentially higher FF pressure without violating CAP.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 151 - Patch Name delta3_micro_and_cross4 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Sequence Generator for FirstFit Coloring**
- **Implementation**: Builds a multi-phase interval sequence: a deterministic four-template spine via _build_blocks_sequential, appends four connectors (with an optional long-range cross4 on the final round), then performs a micro-delta phase using _build_micro_delta_round with four internal windows and parity-based interleaving, followed by a tiny tail. Seeding and window placement are controlled to stay within a 9800-interval capacity, with a deterministic seed strategy (_thin_seed) to ensure reproducibility.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.00; competitive_ratio: 1.85; num_intervals: 9690 (CAP is 9800); results indicate correct, reproducible generation within the capacity bound.
- **Feedback**: The design provides reproducible, tunable control over color pressure via spine templates, connectors, and micro-rounds, balancing FirstFit pressure against omega through capacity guards. While effective and tested, the approach is moderately complex with tight coupling between window placements and connectors; potential refinements could explore dynamic budgeting or alternative seed/shaping strategies for further robustness.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 152 - Patch Name micro_phase_plus - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Generator for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: A multi-phase interval builder that creates (l, r) blocks intended to pressure FirstFit. Phase 1 builds a spine using rotated template blocks and alternating K values, translating and connecting blocks. Phase 2 runs three micro-rounds with scale divisors 2, 3, and 4, employing thin_seed sampling, parity-reversed blocks, local blockers, and shrunk “pins” to bound clique size, plus rotated interleaving and limited connectors. Phase 3 adds final micro-pins to further constrain omega. The CAP is 9800 intervals, with deterministic routines and helper functions (apply_spine_round, thin_seed, micro_round). run_experiment() simply returns construct_intervals().
- **Performance**: Competitive_ratio 1.73 with num_intervals 9800 (CAP=9800); the produced interval set spans large numeric ranges (e.g., around 6.29 million scale), indicating full budget utilization and deterministic, scalable construction.
- **Feedback**: The implementation effectively mixes spine growth with targeted micro-pinnings and parity-based diversification to limit omega while maximizing interval count. It is deterministic and parameterizable, but performance could benefit from analysis of parameter sensitivity (template choices, K values, and sampling density) and potential optimization of the micro-round budget distribution.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 153 - Patch Name micro_shrinker_and_pins - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Multi-Scale Spine + Micro-Phase Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Builds FirstFit intervals via a two-stage generator. Stage 1 runs five spine rounds using four-start templates, combining blocks with dynamic base shifts and alternating interleaving schemes, plus four connector blocks. Stage 2 executes three micro rounds with helper functions to thin seeds and generate micro-blocks around a computed global span, including micro-bridges and multiple connectors. Finally, it normalizes / scales the collected intervals to integers (sf = 1000) relative to the minimum left edge, ensuring valid (li, ri) pairs, with a hard cap of 10,000 intervals; conversion paths handle near-cap cases differently to maintain integer output. The entry point run_experiment calls construct_intervals with defaults.
- **Performance**: Reported metrics include a combined score of 1.80, competitive_ratio of 2.00, and 3591 produced intervals; sample output shows numerous large integer intervals (e.g., around 216481000–216482000, 1026481000–1026482000, etc.). The implementation is deterministic and passes validation in the provided evaluation.
- **Feedback**: The approach offers a reproducible, template-driven construction with two progressively dense phases and explicit cap handling. It yields a substantial interval set with a moderate competitive ratio, and validation confirms correctness; however, it relies on fixed templates and hard caps, which may limit adaptability to varying constraints or different target scales.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 154 - Patch Name multiscale_interleaved_spine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Alternating-density KT spine interval generator**
- **Implementation**: Builds an initial unit interval and a four-template KT bank, then grows a spine by applying translated, interleaved blocks with optional cross4 connectors across several rounds (Stage 1), using alternating density and configurable ordering/parity. It then adds a micro-phase by sampling a thin slice of the spine, constructing two micro-block patterns, interleaving with parity rules, and appending brief connectors, all bounded by CAP.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.00, competitive_ratio 2.00 with 2591 intervals reported, but the submission is incorrect and does not pass all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The approach yields a large, deterministic set of intervals bounded by CAP, but the solution is flagged as incorrect for validation tests, suggesting brittle budgeting, edge-case handling (e.g., empty micro seeds), or mismatches with expected interface/outputs; readability and robustness could be improved with clearer parameter usage and safer boundary handling.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 155 - Patch Name alternating_density_cross4 - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: KT-style Evolve-Block Spine with Parity Interleaving**
- **Implementation**: The code builds a sequence of open intervals by round-robin applying four translation templates (T1–T4) to a seed spine, with optional reversal, a spine density multiplier K, and parity-based interleaving; it then adds six scaled connectors per block, enforces a CAP of 9800 intervals, and, near capacity, executes a micro-phase that samples small seeds, uses four fractional windows, attaches micro-connectors, and caps the result; finally, it normalizes endpoints to be non-negative and clamps to CAP. The public entry point run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals().
- **Performance**: Competitive ratio 1.20 with 3600 intervals generated; configuration shows alg: 24 and opt: 20, with the run validated as correct.
- **Feedback**: The implementation effectively combines multiple templates, parity-driven interleaving, and cross-block connectors with robust capacity guards and final normalization; validation confirms correctness, though the heuristic-driven interval magnitudes and multi-stage complexity are nontrivial.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 156 - Patch Name kt_spine_parity_cross4 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Safeguarded KT-style interval spine builder**
- **Implementation**: Deterministic interval generation using a four-block KT-like spine around fixed starts, with a strict CAP guard (9800) to cap total intervals; a two-stage growth (Stage 1 stable spine expansion and Stage 2 optional micro-rounds) ensures safety and reproducibility.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.10; 9685 intervals produced under CAP with deterministic ordering.
- **Feedback**: Capacity control yields stable, predictable runtime and interval counts; micro-rounds are conservatively gated (phase2_iters ≤ 1) to preserve determinism, while the dormant template bank hints at exploration potential without affecting default behavior.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 157 - Patch Name add_cross4_connector_in_stage1 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT Spine with Rotating Templates and Micro-Phase**

- **Implementation**: Builds a deterministic KT-spine by starting from a single unit interval and expanding via rounds that apply four translated blocks drawn from a rotating template bank. It uses a capacity cap (CAP = 9800) to gate stage-1 growth, computes per-round deltas, and interleaves or concatenates translated blocks depending on round parity. A secondary micro-phase (phase2_iters, up to 2) adds small, windowed micro-blocks with deterministic connectors to boost FirstFit mixing while staying within CAP. The result is a list of open intervals (l, r) in FF presentation order, with an explicit early exit if CAP is approached.

- **Performance**: Achieves 9798 intervals under CAP with a competitive ratio around 2.08 in the provided run, demonstrating strong growth control and targeted mixing despite a fixed capacity guard.

- **Feedback**: The approach is deterministic and validation-friendly, producing near-CAP interval sets that align with the safeguarded spine design. The implementation choices (capacity cap, rotating templates, parity-based interleaving, and a capped micro-phase) balance expansion, color-mixing, and safety, though enabling additional toggles (rotate_starts, reverse_block_parity, interleave_blocks) could be explored in safeguarded modes for further experimentation. Overall, the program passes validation tests and produces consistent results.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 158 - Patch Name micro_phase_cross4_and_parity_interleave - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-based Interval Construction for FirstFit with Micro Rounds**
- **Implementation**: Builds a large set of open intervals using a two-stage approach: Stage 1 applies six KT-style rounds with fixed spine_starts (2, 6, 10, 14) and translations/connectors to grow T under a CAP (9800). Stage 2 adds two micro rounds with delta2 scaling, thin_seed sampling, four translated blocks per spine start, parity-based interleaving to break symmetry, and deterministic connectors, all while respecting the budget to stay under CAP. Seed_count allows pre-seeding with disjoint unit intervals; the function returns the final interval list T.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 2.20 (competitive_ratio 2.20) using 9,676 intervals, comfortably within the 9,800-cap.
- **Feedback**: The two-tier design (macro KT rounds plus micro, cross-scale rounding) stabilizes omega while driving higher FirstFit usage; delta2-scale micro rounds with parity-based interleaving and deterministic connectors enhance diversity without exploding capacity. The approach is reproducible and bounded by CAP, but it remains a heuristic rather than guaranteed optimal solution.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 159 - Patch Name delta2_micro_phase_and_sequential_spine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Rotating KT-Style Spine** 
- **Implementation**: Two-stage interval construction. Stage 1 builds a KT-style spine by repeatedly translating a base interval set T using four rotating templates, interleaving blocks on even rounds and appending connectors to create cross-scale interactions; a CAP guard (9800) halts growth. Stage 2 adds micro-round extensions (delta2-based scaling) with a fixed four-start template, thinning seeds, and extra deterministic connectors plus three long caps, all under a strict budget to keep omega in check while boosting FirstFit pressure. The final interval list is returned as open intervals (l, r) with integer endpoints.
- **Performance**: The approach yields a competitive ratio of about 2.20, producing 9678 intervals in the tested run.
- **Feedback**: The implementation closely follows the intended two-stage construction (spine diversification plus micro-round coupling) and uses disciplined guards to balance FF performance against omega growth. Parameter choices (CAP, templates, and delta2-based scaling) are effective but sensitive; the code is verbose with many hard-coded constants, which may affect robustness if the underlying theory or requirements shift.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 160 - Patch Name micro_phase_delta2_with_cross4 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Spine with Micro Gadget Intervals**
- **Implementation**: Builds a backbone of four-start KT-style spine rounds using a rotating set of templates (template_bank) and a core start set (core_starts). Each spine round translates and optionally reverses blocks, interleaves blocks, and injects connectors to create long-range interactions; a micro-gadget phase adds smaller blocks within a budget to boost FirstFit pressure while keeping total intervals under a CAP of 9800; seeds are thinned to avoid omega inflation, and a capacity guard truncates the sequence if needed.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.00; competitive_ratio ≈ 1.04 with 5099 intervals produced under CAP.
- **Feedback**: The approach achieves a dense interval set while remaining omega-safe and within capacity, using rotation, parity-based interleaving, and connectors to boost FF pressure; the large absolute coordinates and intricate insertion logic add complexity and potential maintenance considerations, though validation tests pass.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 161 - Patch Name parity_round_robin_cross4_towers - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: KT-style spine with micro-rounds**
- **Implementation**: The algorithm builds a deterministic, multi-stage interval construction: Stage 1 creates a KT-style spine using four starting patterns across six rounds with rotated templates and symmetry-breaking ordering, then adds sparse tail caps; Stage 1.5 injects long sparse caps; Stage 2 performs two micro-rounds (micro_round) using four-start translations and delta2 scaling plus a window-based micro-phase (micro_window_round), all under a strict CAP of 9800 intervals. The result is a single, reproducible list of open intervals returned by construct_intervals().
- **Performance**: Competitive ratio ≈ 2.18 (FirstFit uses 24 colors, optimum is 11) with 9800 intervals under the cap; evaluation shows a strong, deterministic construction but not optimal color usage.
- **Feedback**: The layered spine plus micro-rounds approach yields a robust, reproducible construction with careful capacity control, though the final color count is noticeably above optimum and the implementation is fairly intricate.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 162 - Patch Name spine_no_interleave_tailcaps_window_micro - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: KT-Style FirstFit Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Builds a seed set of disjoint unit intervals, then performs six KT-style rounds that translate and interleave blocks based on four start templates, with parity-driven reversals to disrupt FirstFit reuse. It adds sparse connectors, cap-like long intervals, and two micro-phases (A, B, C) that introduce windows and interleavings to densely fill up to a 9800-interval cap, using a nested build_micro routine to generate windowed blocks with optional reversal and interleaving. The final interval set T is capped at CAP=9800 and returned; run_experiment simply calls construct_intervals().
- **Performance**: Delivers exactly 9800 intervals with a competitive_ratio of about 1.43, achieving the target cap while reporting the full interval list used in evaluation.
- **Feedback**: The multi-stage design (rotating templates, parity reversals, interleaving, and micro-phases) effectively diversifies interval placement to elude simple FF-color reuse, yielding solid empirical performance under the evaluator’s metrics; the CAP guard ensures termination and predictable size, though the score remains modest (combined score 0.00) and could be sensitive to seed/template choices.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 163 - Patch Name parity_interleave_plus_dual_micro - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic KT Spine with Safeguarded Cap**
- **Implementation**: A deterministic KT-style interval spine capped at CAP=9800. Stage1 builds a multi-round spine by translating four block templates, optionally interleaving and reversing order, with explicit connectors between blocks. Stage2 optionally adds up to two micro-rounds (phase2) using a seeded, windowed micro-block strategy plus extra connectors, all guarded to stay under CAP. The run_experiment entry point simply invokes construct_intervals().
- **Performance**: Near-capacity generation yields 9798 intervals under CAP 9800, with a competitive_ratio of 1.77 and a evaluation score of 0.00.
- **Feedback**: The design achieves dense, deterministic interval sets with strong safeguards to prevent growth blowups; the two-phase micro rounds provide mixing while staying within bounds. The approach relies on many tuned constants and structural choices (templates, windowing, connectors) that balance density and safety; enabling more features (rotation, interleaving) can increase diversity but requires tighter capacity management.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 164 - Patch Name rotate_spine_two_micro_with_parity - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Parity Spine Intervals for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds a backbone of translated interval blocks using a fixed four-template bank and parity-aware round logic. Stage 1 runs six spine rounds with interleaving and connectors to shape growth, capped by CAP (9600); Stage 2 adds two ultra-thin micro-phases with tight budgets, sparse seeds, and parity-reversed block translations to fill gaps without blowing up the interval count.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.90 with a competitive ratio of 2.11, yielding 2847 intervals.
- **Feedback**: The two-stage design (backbone spine rounds plus micro-phases) effectively limits omega growth while pushing density near CAP; however, the deterministic pattern may produce structured but non-uniform spacing and relies on budget gating to prevent overflow, which could constrain potential improvements in some inputs.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 165 - Patch Name rrp_spine_twostage - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-inspired fractal interval constructor with interleaving**
- **Implementation**: The code builds a list of open intervals by recursively generating four translated blocks from a base pattern, with optional reversal and interleaving to increase FirstFit pressure. It includes helper functions for normalization, a micro-phase to sprinkle long caps, and deterministic connectors; a depth budget bounds growth, and an extra-round phase can be invoked before final normalization.
- **Performance**: The run yields thousands of intervals (observed around ten thousand in test metrics) and reports a competitive ratio around 1.46, but overall scoring shows the solution is incorrect and does not pass validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The approach relies on brittle heuristics (deterministic toggles, rotations, and fixed connectors) and appears to violate budget constraints (cap enforcement, e.g., MAX_INTERVALS) in practice, plus there is an extra, overshadowed duplicate run_experiment definition. These choices undermine correctness and robustness across validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 166 - Patch Name enable_interleaving_and_extended_connectors - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Interleaved Interval Construction for FF**
- **Implementation**: Seeds an initial set T (either a single unit interval or multiple disjoint units), then performs two staged expansions. Stage 1 runs six KT-style rounds by translating T into four blocks anchored at spine_starts (2, 6, 10, 14) and interleaving blocks (even rounds) or concatenating them (odd rounds), followed by fixed connectors; Stage 2 adds two micro rounds using delta2 scaling, thinning via thin_seed, and additional deterministic connectors and sparse caps, all under a CAP guard (9800 total intervals) to bound growth.
- **Performance**: Competitive ratio 2.20 with 9676 intervals produced; uses fixed start-patterns and careful capacity budgeting to reach a strong FF-pressure construction.
- **Feedback**: The approach offers reproducible, pattern-driven growth with explicit capacity controls, yielding solid performance, though the constants and multi-stage logic are intricate and may hinder readability and adaptability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 167 - Patch Name stage1-alternating-interleave - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-style spine with rotating templates**
- **Implementation**: Implements a deterministic KT-like spine seeded at (0,1), expands using four rotating start templates, translates blocks by a span delta, and interleaves or concatenates blocks with optional parity reversal. It adds classic KT-style connectors plus an extra cross4 link, then performs a micro-phase with density-multiplied blocks and a final tail insertion, all guarded by a CAP of 9800 intervals.
- **Performance**: Performance metrics report 10,921 intervals with a competitive_ratio around 1.92, but the overall evaluation flags the run as incorrect (combined score 0.00).
- **Feedback**: The implementation appears to exceed the intended CAP in practice and relies on many interacting toggles (rotation, interleaving, parity) that produce fragile correctness; the combination leads to validation failures and inconsistent results, with traces suggesting boundary mishandling and potential output formatting issues.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 168 - Patch Name add_cross4_parity_and_density_multiplier - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Layered FirstFit interval construction**
- **Implementation**: A two-stage, deterministic interval builder. Stage 1 constructs a backbone by iteratively translating and concatenating four fixed-start blocks (starts = (2,6,10,14)) with connectors to stabilize omega; Stage 2 expands the set via two micro-rounds that generate four translated blocks per seed, apply parity-based reversals, interleave blocks, add deterministic connectors and sparse local caps, all under a global capacity CAP = 9800. Intervals are treated as open (l, r) pairs and the process is capped to prevent exponential growth.
- **Performance**: Achieves a competitive_ratio of 2.20 with 9,676 intervals generated (final interval list shown; algorithm/complexity indicators: alg: 22; opt: 10).
- **Feedback**: The construction is correct and reproducible, with a well-bounded growth strategy that enforces termination and stability. The two-stage, fixed-start backbone plus micro-round expansions yields the target ratio, though the resulting set is dense and large, suggesting potential trade-offs between compactness and ratio guarantees.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 169 - Patch Name kt_backbone_with_micro_rounds - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-spine with micro-round interval construction**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of open intervals in two stages: (1) six deterministic spine rounds using rotated KT-like templates and optional interleaving with classic connectors, producing a large block-structured arrangement; (2) two micro-round extensions driven by thin, delta2-like sampling with four interior windows and fractional connectors. A capacity guard (CAP = 9800) limits total intervals, seed starts at (0,1), and the main function returns after running the two stages; run_experiment simply invokes construct_intervals.
- **Performance**: Score 1.90 (combined), competitive_ratio 2.71, generating 9800 intervals within CAP.
- **Feedback**: The implementation effectively balances FirstFit pressure against omega growth via deterministic spine rounds and guarded micro-rounds, using interleaving/parity and sparse connectors to couple scales. The CAP-based cutoff ensures stable runtime but makes performance highly sensitive to parameter choices (seed strategy, templates, and cap), though validation indicates correctness and successful completion within bounds.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 170 - Patch Name rotate_interleave_plus_window_micro - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic KT Spine with Safeguarded Two-Phase Scaffold**
- **Implementation**: Implements a capacity-bounded two-stage expansion: Stage 1 builds a KT-spine by translating four blocks per round around fixed starts and optionally interleaving, guarded by a CAP of 9800. Stage 2 optionally adds a micro delta round built from a small seed of the spine using four windowed blocks across the global span, with deterministic connectors, optional parabolic micro-phase, and a phase2_iters gate that limits to at most one micro-round by default; all steps are designed to keep the interval count under CAP.
- **Performance**: Performance yields a combined score of 2.10 and competitive ratio of 2.33, producing 9,684 intervals (near the 9,800-cap) with a deterministic, near-capacity KT-like structure.
- **Feedback**: The safeguarded, capacity-bounded design provides stable, deterministic interval generation close to the limit, with optional micro- and parabolic phases offering FF diversity within bounds. To explore broader diversity, one would need to relax caps or enable additional modes, noting the risk of exceeding the capacity guard.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 171 - Patch Name parabolic_micro_option - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-spine multi-scale micro-phase interval construction**
- **Implementation**: Implements a hierarchical interval generator that starts with a Kierstead–Trotter spine (seed intervals and four translated spine blocks per round) and interleaves them across rounds, with delta-based scaling and connectors to form a backbone. It then adds two micro-phases: a primary delta2-scale phase that thins and distributes a seed across four scaled blocks with parity reversals, followed by a windowed secondary phase that embeds scaled seeds into four fixed percentile windows, with occasional bridges and limited cross-connections, all bounded by a CAP of 9800.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 1.60 with 9,736 intervals (alg=16, opt=10).
- **Feedback**: Correct and passes validation tests; the design uses deterministic thinning, parity-based mixing, and scaled connectors to balance backbone growth with micro-scale diversification, though it yields a sizable interval set under CAP.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 172 - Patch Name cross4_dual_micro_v2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-coupled FirstFit interval constructor**
- **Implementation**: Implements a two-stage interval construction inspired by Figure 4 of arXiv:1506.00192 to maximize FirstFit colors relative to maximum overlap. It builds a large list of open intervals with a cap CAP=9800, using an initial four-start pattern (2,6,10,14) to form translated blocks and connectors in six rounds, then adds micro-extensions via thin_seed and micro_round with scaled deltas, multiple start templates, and deterministic parity-based reordering to amplify cross-scale coupling; finally returns the full interval set T.
- **Performance**: Reports competitive_ratio ≈ 2.09 with 9697 intervals (near CAP 9800); validation notes the algorithm as correct and passing tests, with additional metadata showing alg: 23 and opt: 11.
- **Feedback**: The implementation faithfully encodes the KT/backbone strategy with deterministic seeds, multi-scale translations, and controlled budget to balance omega and color usage. It achieves near-capacity interval counts and stable behavior, but the approach is quite intricate and parameter-sensitive, suggesting benefits from thorough documentation and potential simplification for maintainability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 173 - Patch Name dual_micro_with_cross4 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-Style Spined Blocks with Deterministic Micro-Rounds**
- **Implementation**: Builds a spine via six KT-style rounds using four translated block templates and fixed connectors; translates blocks by computed base from (lo, delta, starts); uses a deterministic seed selection (_thin_seed_with_offset) to choose a small seed U, then constructs micro-blocks over window pairs with optional parity reversal, followed by deterministic fractional-span connectors; all endpoints are integers with a large CAP (9800). No randomness is used; seeding relies on a simple hash (base, Knuth constant) to diversify seeds across micro-phases.
- **Performance**: Produces a fixed sequence of 9800 intervals; reported metrics: combined score 1.90, competitive_ratio 2.71; intervals span large numeric ranges (examples shown around 813k–814k), indicating substantial translations without RNG variance.
- **Feedback**: The design emphasizes reproducibility and deliberate FF-pressure amplification via staged blocks and micro-round interleaving; deterministic seeds and window-based micro-blocks provide controlled diversity, though the reported competitive ratio suggests room for further optimization and/or tuning of window sets and connectors.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 174 - Patch Name dual_micro_spine_cross4 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Sequential Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Builds intervals by maintaining a spine T and expanding it over six rounds using four deterministic templates. Each round translates blocks based on lo, hi, and delta, with a density multiplier K (1 early, 2 late), then appends four fixed connectors and, in the last rounds, a long-range cross4; a micro-tail near the end adds sparse long caps to boost late FirstFit coloring while capping omega.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.00; competitive_ratio 1.58; 9565 intervals generated (CAP 9800); validations pass.
- **Feedback**: The approach uses a deterministic, seed-controlled, capacity-bounded expansion with tunable density and connectors to increase color pressure, plus a micro-tail to affect late coloring. Evaluation shows alg: 19 vs opt: 12, indicating potential gains from template/seed or tail-tuning refinements.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 175 - Patch Name adaptive_density_and_cross4_boost - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Builds 9800 capacity intervals via a two-stage pattern engine: Stage 1 (Spine) expands a seed set using predefined start_patterns, delta scaling, and interleaving rules with connectors to densely pack blocks; Stage 2 (Two micro-phases) refines coverage with a build_micro routine that samples a subset, applies window-based blocks, interleaves, and appends classic/cross connectors plus safe caps, finally trimming to CAP.
- **Performance**: Deterministic generation yields exactly CAP intervals (9800) with a combined score of 1.80 and competitive_ratio of 2.00; the output sequence is a long list of coordinate pairs spanning multiple near-equal bands.
- **Feedback**: The approach is solid and pattern-driven, delivering consistent, dense packing and clear modular stages; however, it relies on hard-coded constants (patterns, windows, caps) which may limit generalization to different capacities or distributions and could benefit from parameterization or adaptive tuning.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 176 - Patch Name spine_interleaved_dualmicro - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Laminated Interval Evolve-Block Construction**
- **Implementation**: Builds a laminated spine of open intervals by six rounds of translated copies using a four-template bank, with per-round density control and optional inner-block reversal; attaches long connectors (including cross4) between blocks, then enforces a ten-track colorability guard via a greedy left-endpoint coloring, followed by two deterministic delta-2 micro-phases that deterministically extend the interval set within a strict CAP and finally truncates to CAP. The code uses helper routines for block construction, interleaving, and a binary-search-based prefix extension guarded by the 10-track test.
- **Performance**: Composite score 1.60; competitive ratio 1.60; number of intervals capped at 9800.
- **Feedback**: The approach cleanly combines lamination, deterministic micro-phases, and a rigorous ten-track certificate to maximize FirstFit usage while keeping omega ≤ 10; the ten-track guard with binary-prefix extension ensures safety but relies on several hard-coded constants and geometry choices that may affect readability and tunability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 177 - Patch Name ten_track_laminated_ff - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-inspired Fractal Interval Constructor**
- **Implementation**: A fractal-style interval generator that builds four translated blocks per round from a seed interval, with optional reversal and interleaving. It adds deterministic connectors, sprinkles a micro-phase at the end, enforces a MAX_INTERVALS budget, and finally normalizes endpoints to non-negative integers.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.10 with about 10,648 intervals generated (endpoints can be in the millions), but the approach is flagged as incorrect in validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The evaluator notes correctness issues: the file defines run_experiment twice, with the latter ignoring incoming kwargs, causing parameterization (e.g., depth) to be ineffective; the heuristic, brittle construction (fixed patterns, micro-phase, and connectors) is not reliably validated, leading to test failures.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 178 - Patch Name enable_interleaving_blocks - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Rotating KT spine with fractional micro phases**
- **Implementation**: Constructs an evolving interval spine by translating four blocks from a template bank per round, with optional interleave/reverse behavior and appended connectors; a hard CAP guard (9800) prevents overflow, and after the spine it applies two micro-phase stages (A and B) to adjust density, controlled by phase2_iters.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.30; competitive_ratio 2.30; produced 9,687 intervals under CAP.
- **Feedback**: The design is modular and tunable (rounds, templates, interleave, parity), but safety defaults (e.g., add_cross4 off) and strict capacity constraints influence density and determinism, with the micro-phase logic adding complexity for maintenance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 179 - Patch Name rot_spine_microcaps_v2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic KT-style spine with rotating templates**
- **Implementation**: Builds a deterministic open-interval spine by seeding with (0,1) and expanding in rounds using a KT-like growth (size transforms as 4*size + 4). It supports rotating among four strong start templates, optional parity-based interleaving, and optional per-round reordering. Each round translates four base blocks, concatenates or interleaves them, and appends a set of classic connectors. A CAP guard (9800) caps total intervals. A second micro-phase adds a tail of long caps near the end (with a small set of fractional-positioned caps), followed by up to two micro-rounds that generate small, windowed blocks around the current span with deterministic window schedules and optional alternation. The function is parameterized by rounds, rotate_starts, reverse_block_parity, interleave_blocks, and phase2_iters, and aims to produce about 9800 intervals in FF presentation order.
- **Performance**: Score 2.30 with 9800 intervals generated (near the designed capacity). The implementation enforces a hard cap to prevent blow-up and includes a micro-phase to boost mixing without surpassing CAP.
- **Feedback**: The design uses a modular, layered approach (stage 1 spine, tail caps, micro-phases) to balance growth and mixing. Rotation and parity toggling create variation while remaining deterministic, and the tail/micro rounds improve mixing without large-scale expansion. Clear guards (CAP and budget checks) ensure predictable resource usage. Potential refinements could include parameterizing CAP and round growth more explicitly for broader experimentation, or exposing diagnostics to observe how template choices affect interval distribution.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 180 - Patch Name delta2_dual_phase_cross4 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Multi-Round Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of intervals by seeds, four templates, and three start-patterns; iteratively expands via translated copies of the current interval set with deterministic jitter, adds bridging intervals and sparse caps, then performs a two-phase micro-expansion before optional extra rounds; returns the final list of intervals without validation checks.
- **Performance**: Produces a very large interval set (e.g., around 896,675 intervals) with a modest competitive ratio (~1.04) but a zero overall score, indicating poor optimization and impractical runtime/memory profile.
- **Feedback**: Evaluation shows the approach inflates interval counts and relies on deterministic jitter, and the tests fail, likely due to semantic/constraint mismatches (open vs closed intervals, bounds, or formatting) and potential instability from multi-round expansion; recommended to prune growth, verify interval semantics, and ensure compliance with expected validation constraints.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 32 - Patch Name add_micro_phase_and_increase_rounds - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Builder for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds intervals in three staged passes. Stage 1 uses a fixed 4-start pattern (2,6,10,14) over 6 rounds to translate and append blocks with connectors, forming T. Stage 2 adds two micro-rounds (with delta2 scaling, thinning, parity-based block reversal, and interleaving) plus deterministic connectors and sparse caps, under a CAP guard. Stage 3 optionally adds a fine micro-round with a larger scale and a different start set (3,7,11,15). All intervals are open (l, r) and the process is bounded to stay under CAP=9800 elements.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.20; competitive_ratio 2.20 with 9727 intervals (near the 9800 cap), producing coordinates in the mid-1e6 range.
- **Feedback**: The approach yields a reproducible, high-density interval set that achieves a strong KT-style backbone while controlling omega via staged scaling and connectors. Close to capacity, it demonstrates stability and deterministic behavior, though it relies on fixed parameters (CAP, start patterns) that could be parameterized for broader exploration or robustness.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 181 - Patch Name add_third_fine_micro_round_and_cross4 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Spine with Micro-Rounds**

- **Implementation**: The code constructs intervals by computing the span and delta of a seed set, then builds translated blocks for four spine-start positions, appending four connectors (left cap, right cap, cross 1, cross 2) and an optional long-range cross4. It uses a two-stage approach: Stage 1 runs six KT-spine rounds with deterministic interleaving to amplify color pressure, followed by Stage 2 micro-rounds (delta2 scale) that generate compact, seed-derived blocks with alternating ordering and additional connectors, capped by a final optional parabolic micro-phase; a CAP bound (9800) prevents runaway growth.

- **Performance**: Combined score: 2.20 (competitive_ratio 2.20); num_intervals: 9676; intervals include numerous small adjacent intervals; alg: 22; opt: 10.

- **Feedback**: The implementation effectively pressures FirstFit via a deterministic spine plus micro-round diversification, while CAP keeps growth manageable and tail additions boost late FF pressure. The design combines staged expansion with targeted micro-variations and passes validation tests.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 182 - Patch Name hybridKT_micro_parabolic - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic KT Spine with Rotating Templates**
- **Implementation**: Builds a KT-style spine by expanding an interval list T starting from [(0,1)]. It caps growth at CAP=9800 using a round_next_size(sz) = 4*sz + 4 model and max_rounds_within_cap. Each round translates four template blocks (from a rotating bank) by a delta derived from the current span, optionally interleaving and reversing order, then appends classic 4 connectors (and an optional long-range cross) via _append_connectors. A tail-insertion step adds short caps near the end, followed by a two-stage micro-phase (Stage 2) that generates small, windowed blocks from seeds derived from T, with deterministic window positions, interleaving, and connectors; a final extra micro-phase with a distinct window profile further densifies mixing. The process is entirely deterministic (no randomness) and parameterized by rotate_starts, reverse_block_parity, interleave_blocks, and phase2_iters.
  
- **Performance**: The generator targets CAP 9800 intervals and achieves that capacity (9800 intervals) with a competitive_ratio of ~1.85 and a total intervals list of 9800, demonstrating stable, high-volume spine construction within bounds.

- **Feedback**: The approach is thorough and deterministic, using rotating templates and structured connectors to control growth and mixing, with micro-phases ensuring fine-grained coverage near the cap. While effective and bounded, the implementation relies on many fixed constants and careful orchestration of rounds, which may impact readability and extensibility; performance remains acceptable due to explicit capacity guards and staged expansion.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 183 - Patch Name cross4_plus_dual_micro - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolved KT Spine with Guarded Micro-Phases**
- **Implementation**: Implements a KT-inspired spine builder with guarded micro-phases. It evolves an interval list starting from (0,1) by applying rotated four-start templates across spine rounds, then performs two micro-phases that build delta2 blocks from windowed seeds, adds local caps, and finally inserts a tail, all under a hard cap with deterministic LCG seeds and capacity guards.
- **Performance**: Competitive_ratio: 1.36; num_intervals: 9639.
- **Feedback**: Strengths include modular spine + micro-phase separation with deterministic seeding and rotation-based diversity, achieving reproducible results within CAP. The approach relies on tuned knobs (CAP, density K, windows, templates) and heuristic tail-caps, which may limit generalization and require careful parameter tuning.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 184 - Patch Name kt_spine_evolved - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Safeguarded KT Spine with Micro-Delta Phase**
- **Implementation**: A deterministic KT-style spine is built under a strict CAP (9800) using four translated blocks per round around the current interval span, with optional interleaving and a two-phase scaffold: Stage 1 constructs the spine with connectors, and Stage 2 adds cap- and window-based micro-rounds seeded from Stage 1, plus an optional parabolic micro-phase to boost FF diversity; all expansions are guarded to prevent overflow and maintain omega limits.
- **Performance**: Capacity-bounded to 9800 intervals, yielding a fixed set with metrics: combined score 0.00, competitive_ratio 2.00; alg: 24; opt: 12.
- **Feedback**: The approach is deterministic and reproducible, with explicit safeguards that cap growth and provide predictable results; the two-phase design plus micro-rounds and optional parabolic phase deliver FF color diversity while keeping interval growth under control, and validation confirms correctness.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 185 - Patch Name micro_phase_enhancements - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic KT-inspired Fractal Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Builds intervals by starting from a single unit, iteratively forming four translated blocks per round from deterministic start patterns (with optional reversal), interleaving blocks and adding fixed connectors (caps); tight memory control via MAX_INTERVALS (9800), depth derived from a growth bound, and optional micro-phases (append_micro_phase and two-stage micro-delta rounds) to tune the distribution before a final normalization.
- **Performance**: Score 2.10 with a competitive ratio of 2.10, producing the maximum 9800 intervals under the defined cap in a fully deterministic, bounded-process pipeline.
- **Feedback**: The approach leverages modular, deterministic patterns to increase FirstFit pressure while guarding omega, with micro-phases and connectors to shape distribution; it is efficient and validation-tested, though results rely on fixed patterns that yield large coordinate values and a pronounced, predictable structure.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 186 - Patch Name delta2_micro_two_stage - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Rotating KT Spine with Micro-Phases**  
- **Implementation**: Builds a rotating KT spine by applying translated templates (four-block blocks) to an evolving interval list, with optional interleave and parity flipping, plus fixed left/right/cross connectors and an optional cross4. It enforces a CAP (~9800 intervals), then injects two micro-phase rounds via deterministic, seed-offset sampled windows to densely fill the budget, and trims to CAP at the end.  
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 1.90; competitive_ratio: 2.71; num_intervals: 9688.  
- **Feedback**: Deterministic and validation-passing design achieves high interval density near capacity through multi-stage spine construction and micro-phases; capacity management and knob-driven variations offer robustness but add implementation complexity that could affect reproducibility across configurations.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 187 - Patch Name kt_spine_dual_micro_cross4 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hybrid KT spine interval sequence optimizer**
- **Implementation**: Constructs a sequence of intervals by translating four-block KT spines using rotated start templates, applying six rounds with alternating interleave and block order, and then injecting micro-rounds (tail caps, delta-driven seeds) and optional parabolic caps to fill up to CAP (9800). Core helpers manage span translation, connector blocks, and the interleaving/reversing logic to mix colors across blocks.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 2.30 with 9,800 intervals; competitive_ratio reported as 2.30 (best-known metric for the run).
- **Feedback**: The approach blends a six-round KT spine with varied templates, plus targeted micro-phases to maximize color spread and overlap complexity. While effective and bounded by a clear CAP, the solution relies on numerous heuristic parameters (round structure, tail injections, delta-based blocks, and optional parabolic caps), which may be sensitive to domain specifics and could benefit from parameter-tuning or ablation studies. The implementation is self-contained and validated against tests, producing a consistent result within the stated metrics.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 188 - Patch Name kt_spine_rotated_micro_mix - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT Spine Interval Evolve for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of translated blocks from a KT-spine seed, cycling through four rotated templates with optional interleaving and reversal. It then appends four classic connectors and applies two micro-phases (long-range caps and delta-window rounds) before a final capacity trim, all guarded by a CAP limit to keep intervals under 9800.
- **Performance**: Combined score: 2.30; competitive_ratio: 2.30; number of intervals: 9687.
- **Feedback**: The approach uses a multi-phase, template-driven KT-spine construction with deterministic perturbations (interleave/reverse, long-range caps, and fractional-window micro-rounds) to maximize FirstFit efficiency while controlling omega via strategic connectors and cap windows; it passes validation tests and stays within capacity, though results are tightly coupled to CAP and seed strategy.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 189 - Patch Name kt_spine_rot_win_micro - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: Rotated KT Spine with Micro Rounds**
- **Implementation**: Core logic builds translated blocks from an evolving interval seed using rotated KT-start templates, with options for interleaving and reverse ordering. It appends classic connectors (caps and cross-links) and introduces a two-phase micro-round system (A and B) plus optional parabolic caps, all under a fixed 9800-cap to craft a challenging FirstFit instance.
- **Performance**: The run yields about 1.79 in competitive ratio across 9800 intervals, with explicit interval sequences generated and validated as correct by tests.
- **Feedback**: The combination of rotated KT templates, interleaved/block-order tweaks, and staged micro-rounds effectively increases color spread while managing omega-pressure via delayed long-range connectors; the implementation is robust and passes validation.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 190 - Patch Name cross4_micro_center_windows - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block FirstFit Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: Builds an adversarial interval sequence by seeding with disjoint unit intervals, then performing six deterministic rounds using a four-template bank to translate and interleave copies of the seed, followed by connector intervals. Three micro-phases (A, B, C) add long-range caps, micro-rounds, and pin-sized blocks to boost colors while capping omega, all under a CAP guard (9800) and returning the final interval list T.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.30; competitive_ratio 2.30 with 9785 intervals generated under CAP 9800.
- **Feedback**: The approach employs a deterministic, templated construction inspired by a published figure, using interleaving and connectors to diversify FirstFit behavior while micro-phases manage omega growth; results validate strong performance within the given constraints, though the solution is quite intricate and relies on numerous hard-coded parameters that may affect portability and tunability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 191 - Patch Name second_micro_phase_pins - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Constructor for FF**
- **Implementation**: Builds a seed set of disjoint unit intervals and evolves them through staged KT-like rounds (Stage 1) with rotating templates and parity-based interleaving, followed by a Stage 1.5 cap injection. It then performs two micro-extension rounds (Stage 2) using delta2-driven translations, plus a Stage 2.5 window-based micro-phase. A fixed CAP (9800) guards total intervals, with several helper routines for thinning seeds and applying deterministic connectors and interleavings.
- **Performance**: Achieves a competitive ratio around 2.18 with 9800 intervals, maintaining the capacity cap and producing large-coordinate interval sets intended to stress FirstFit, and it passes all validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The multi-stage, parameterized construction (rotating templates, interleaving parity, and sparse connectors) effectively increases FF pressure while bounding omega, but the approach is complex and parameter-sensitive; the CAP guard and deterministic patterns help ensure safety and reproducibility, though further tuning could yield tighter performance or simpler analysis.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 192 - Patch Name rotating_spine_plus_window_micro - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic KT-style spine with micro-phase blocks**
- **Implementation**: Implements a KT-style spine with a hard capacity cap (CAP = 9800). It starts from a single interval, grows via a size recurrence (size -> 4*size + 4), and builds rounds using a rotating template bank, optional interleaving, and parity-based block reversal; a set of connectors is added to enforce coupling. Stage 2 adds up to two micro-rounds with delta-scaled windows (thin_seed and build_micro_delta_round) to increase FF usage, followed by normalization, integerization, and a final CAP trim.
- **Performance**: Combined score 1.50 with competitive_ratio 1.67, producing 9800 intervals; the implementation yields a dense, deterministic interval set near the cap.
- **Feedback**: The approach leverages rotation, parity flipping, interleaving, and micro-phases to diversify structure and maximize interval usage under a fixed cap, yielding reproducible results. The method relies on many hard-coded constants and heuristic connectors, which improves performance but may affect readability and adaptability; future work could parameterize constants and add more formal guarantees or validation.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 193 - Patch Name kt_micro_crossover - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Generator for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds a staged interval sequence starting with a KT-style deterministic spine and rotating start templates, then expands with interleaved translated blocks and connectors; a second micro-round stage uses delta2 scaling, four-start templates, parity-based interleaving, and sparse long-range connectors, all guarded by a CAP of 9800 intervals and a final tail-cap insertion. The main entry point run_experiment simply returns construct_intervals().
- **Performance**: Produces 9731 intervals with a competitive_ratio of 2.00 and a combined score of 0.00 (validated as correct in tests).
- **Feedback**: The design closely follows the referenced Figure 4 construction, balancing diversification and omega control through staged expansion and careful connectors; deterministic, parameterized shaping enables predictable behavior but results in a fairly large, heuristic-generated interval set.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 194 - Patch Name add_cross4_and_third_micro_phase - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-spine FirstFit interval generator with micro-phase expansion**
- **Implementation**: Builds a spine of intervals by applying 6 rounds of rotated KT templates, with interleave/reverse ordering per round, then adds three long-range caps and two micro-phase rounds (A and C) that construct translated, window-aligned blocks and fractional connectors. All steps enforce a CAP (9800 intervals) to keep memory/compute bounded, and final trimming ensures the total never exceeds CAP.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 2.30 with 9800 intervals (num_intervals: 9800) as reported by the evaluator.
- **Feedback**: The multi-phase design (KT spine plus micro-phase expansions) provides diversified interval placement to maximize FF pressure while controlling omega growth; capacity guards and windowed micro-blocks help stabilize results at near-capacity scale.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 195 - Patch Name dual_microphase_plus - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block: FirstFit Interval Construction**
- **Implementation**: Builds a long sequence of open intervals by cycling through four start-pattern templates over six deterministic rounds, translating and interleaving blocks to couple colors across scales. It then adds three long-range caps (micro-phase A) and two guarded micro-rounds (micro-phases B and C) with carefully chosen windows and connectors, all under a capacity guard (~9900 intervals). The function returns the final interval list T of (l, r) pairs and is invoked by run_experiment.
- **Performance**: Competitive_ratio 2.00 with 9,835 intervals produced under the 9,900-capacity limit; evaluation shows correct behavior and reproducible results, with validation tests passing.
- **Feedback**: The design uses multi-round translations, parity-based interleaving, and layered micro-phases to boost FirstFit color usage while keeping omega in check. The approach is deterministic and highly parameterized, yielding stable results but with notable implementation complexity; overall, it achieves a solid 2-approximation and validates successfully.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 196 - Patch Name crossscale_micro_enhancements - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic Braided Spine Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Builds a capacity-bounded spine of open intervals using a fixed four-start template bank (rotated across rounds), deterministic LCG seed, and a modular pipeline: spine rounds with parity-based interleaving and reversal, connectors (including occasional cross-range), and a two-phase micro-phase system (A and B) with windowed translations, sparse long-range connectors, and budget-limited micro-intervals; finally, normalizes endpoints to non-negative integers and ensures positive length, returning arrival-order intervals up to CAP (9800).
- **Performance**: Competitive_ratio ~1.42 with full capacity achieved (9800 intervals produced).
- **Feedback**: Results are reproducible due to the deterministic seed usage; the sample output shows a duplicate interval, indicating potential non-uniqueness or overlap that may warrant deduplication or additional validation.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 197 - Patch Name braided_parity_pulse_spine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-inspired Deterministic Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of open integer-endpoint intervals under a capacity cap (CAP=9800) using a KT-like backbone across multiple rounds. It translates a base seed template into blocks, interleaves or reverses them by round parity, and adds deterministic connectors to pressure FirstFit while controlling omega. A second stage adds fractional-window micro-rounds (A and B) with deterministic shifts, thin seeds, and parity-based ordering, all without randomness.
- **Performance**: Produces about 2540 intervals with CAP enforcement (approx. competitive_ratio 1.92 in evaluation) and completes within the capacity bounds; validation reports correctness and test success.
- **Feedback**: The design favors determinism (no RNG) for reproducibility and uses modular helpers (span_delta, build_blocks, connectors, micro rounds) to tune FF pressure vs. omega. While effective, the approach relies on many hard-coded heuristics and window templates, which may limit generalization and require careful tuning for other CAP settings.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 198 - Patch Name dual_micro_cross4_pipeline - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-inspired Block Interval Evolver**
- **Implementation**: Builds intervals by repeated, translation-based blocks with four start patterns, optional inner reversal, and round-dependent interleaving. It appends deterministic connectors (caps/crosses), adds end-phase micro-intervals, and then performs two micro-delta passes plus parabolic micro-phases, all capped by a MAX_INTERVALS budget and final normalization to integers.
- **Performance**: Achieves a competitive ratio around 1.91 at the 9800-interval cap, generating a dense sequence of intervals (9800 total) under deterministic, tunable controls.
- **Feedback**: The approach is highly deterministic and modular, enabling fine-grained control over block layout and micro-phases to push First-Fit pressure without inflating omega. However, the design relies on many constants and heuristic patterns, which can hinder easier tuning and readability, and may complicate adaptation to different constraints or objectives.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 199 - Patch Name add_final_spine_cross4_and_parabolic_micro - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block KT-Spine Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Builds a list of open intervals with integer endpoints under a hard CAP (9800). It uses deterministic spine rounds driven by SPINE_TEMPLATES, translating and merging translated blocks, and appends classic connectors via kt_connectors; additional long connectors are optionally added to couple extremes. The workflow includes a spine stage (up to 6 rounds), a near-tail tail-cap insertion, and two micro-phase rounds with windowed seeds and cross-layer connectors, all constrained by a budget at each step.
- **Performance**: Achieves 2803 intervals with a competitive ratio around 1.32 under the CAP constraint.
- **Feedback**: The multi-stage, deterministic design balances interval growth and FirstFit color mixing through structured templates and connectors, providing diversity while bounding omega; however, endpoint magnitudes can grow large due to translations, and the approach relies on manual parameter tuning (templates, window windows, and budgets) for stability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 200 - Patch Name two_stage_spine_micro_connector_v2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Safeguarded KT Spine with Micro-Phase**
- **Implementation**: Builds a deterministic KT-style spine with a capacity guard (CAP = 9800) and a two-stage expansion: Stage 1 applies multiple translated blocks with interleaving on even rounds and fixed connectors; Stage 2 optionally adds a micro delta round (bounded by budget) derived from a seeded sample of the spine, plus an optional parabolic micro-phase to boost diversity. The seed starts from [(0, 1)], and the function enforces a strict cap to avoid omega blow-up; run_experiment calls construct_intervals with default settings.
- **Performance**: Produces up to 9690 intervals under CAP with a competitive_ratio of ~1.85; overall score reported as 0.00.
- **Feedback**: The safeguarded two-stage design effectively caps interval growth while preserving KT-like structure, achieving near-CAP utilization and reproducible results. The parabolic micro-phase adds diversity but remains bounded; some components (e.g., template_bank) are dormant, suggesting potential reuse for controlled experimentation or tunable micro-patterns.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 201 - Patch Name enhance_micro_connectivity_and_enable_dual_micro - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-like Spine with Guarded Micro-Phases**
- **Implementation**: A deterministic, multi-stage spine builder uses four-start templates, a 9800-capacity cap, and a suite of helpers (span_delta, max_rounds_within_cap, thin_seed, apply_spine_round, build_micro_round). It alternates spine rounds with parity-based interleaving/reversal, adds long-range connectors (cross4) in later rounds, and then emits two micro-phase rounds (A and B) with window-fracs, deterministic tagging, and local scaling. Final coordinates are normalized to integers and trimmed to CAP, yielding a FirstFit-ordered list of open intervals.
- **Performance**: Competitive_ratio ~1.69 with 9672 intervals produced under a 9800-capacity plan; results are deterministic and reproducible.
- **Feedback**: The approach achieves near-capacity utilization with structured, reproducible outputs and modular helpers, though the implementation is quite intricate; opportunities exist to simplify the connector logic or tighten parameterization for readability and potential runtime improvements.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 202 - Patch Name multi_stage_cross4_spine - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Constructor**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of open intervals via a two-stage process. Stage 1 runs six deterministic spine rounds using a rotating template_bank to create four translated blocks plus connectors; Stage 2 adds two micro rounds driven by delta2, thin seeds, and interleaving (forward/reverse) with additional connectors and long micro caps, all constrained by a CAP of 9800 and a final micro-tail to boost late FF pressure.
- **Performance**: CAP guards keep the total interval count under 9800; the run produced 9721 intervals with a reported competitive_ratio of 1.62.
- **Feedback**: The design clearly balances density and clique-avoidance through staged construction, translations, and varied interleaving; parameters (seed_count, CAP, delta choices) critically shape outcomes and stability, while the approach remains deterministic and capacity-aware, yielding consistent results within the guardrails.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 203 - Patch Name rotate_spine_add_cross4_and_micro_tail - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-Style Deterministic Spine Intervals**
- **Implementation**: Builds a deterministic KT-like interval spine using four strong start templates (rotated across rounds), with options for rotating starts, parity-based interleaving, and optional cross-block connectors. It translates blocks by a round-local delta, applies connectors, and adds two micro-phases of small, deterministic windows (with an alt window set) plus long-range cross4 connectors and tail caps, all bounded by a capacity cap (CAP=9800) to produce a list of open intervals.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 1.60 with 9829 intervals produced under a 9800-cap logic, using a deterministic and capacity-conscious generation process.
- **Feedback**: The implementation neatly combines KT-spine expansion, controlled symmetry breaking, and micro-phase diversification to maximize interval count within capacity; its heavy use of toggles (rotate_starts, interleave_blocks, reverse_block_parity, add_cross4) and two micro-phase passes provide reproducible yet varied structure. While effective, the approach is complex with multiple interacting heuristics and tight capacity management, which may require careful tuning if constraints shift.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 204 - Patch Name kt_spine_dual_micro_cross4 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Spine Interval Constructor**  
- **Implementation**: Generates a long interval sequence via six spine rounds of rotated KT-style blocks using a template bank, seeded with (0,1), and guarded by CAP=9800. It translates, interleaves, and concatenates blocks, adds long-range caps, and then applies two micro-rounds with thin seeds and windowed translations to boost FF pressure while controlling omega.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.10 with competitive_ratio 2.33, producing 9800 intervals; validation tests pass.
- **Feedback**: The multi-stage design with capacity guards and interleaving effectively balances FF pressure and omega, but the dense, large-interval scheme reduces readability—consider refactoring for clarity and adding invariants/tests for FF/omega behavior.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 205 - Patch Name rotating_spine_fractional_micro_with_caps - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic KT-Spine with Micro-Phase Expansion**
- **Implementation**: Builds a deterministic KT spine starting from [(0,1)], applying up to 5 rounds with four fixed templates; includes helpers for span calculations, round translation, and a micro-rounder that seeds small blocks, interleaves them across windows, and appends fixed fractional connectors. Micro-phases A and B add structured windows and extra passes with capacity caps (CAP=9800) to grow the interval set without excessive omega, followed by optional extra iterations.
- **Performance**: CAP=9800 bounds growth; evaluation reports 2472 intervals with a competitive_ratio of 1.85.
- **Feedback**: The approach yields reproducible, well-structured interval sets and uses distinct micro-phase windows to intensify FirstFit pressure, but the implementation relies on many constants and heuristics which reduce readability and may limit portability across parameter changes. Potential improvements include parameterizing templates and budgets for easier tuning and analysis.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 206 - Patch Name ff_spine_dual_micro_v2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-inspired FirstFit worst-case interval construction**
- **Implementation**: Seeds with disjoint unit intervals, then executes six KT-style rounds that translate blocks around four spine starts with parity-based interleaving and fixed connectors; a CAP guard (9800) limits total intervals. A second phase runs micro-rounds using thinning seeds, four-start templates, and delta2 scaling to extend within the cap, all returning a list of open intervals.
- **Performance**: Achieves a competitive ratio of 2.20, using the full capacity of 9800 intervals (CAP=9800) for scoring.
- **Feedback**: The design leverages deterministic, multi-scale coupling (parity interleaving, translations, and sparse connectors) to maximize FirstFit pressure while bounding omega via guarded micro-phases; saturating the interval cap yields the reported score, though at the cost of higher complexity and memory usage.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 207 - Patch Name dual_window_microphase - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic KT Spine with Rotating Templates**
- **Implementation**: Builds a KT-style spine by translating the current interval set into four blocks per round using a bank of strong start templates; enforces a hard CAP(9800), adds deterministic connectors, and supports stage-1 rotation/interleaving with parity-based reversal plus a two-stage micro-phase (delta-based micro-blocks) to boost mixing while staying under the cap.
- **Performance**: Score 2.30; 9800 intervals produced under CAP.
- **Feedback**: The approach deterministically saturates the allowed interval count with layered phases for robust mixing; while effective, the implementation is fairly complex—consider simplifying or parameterizing to aid readability and tunability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 208 - Patch Name second_microphase_cross4 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-Spine Multi-Phase Interval Evolver**
- **Implementation**: Builds an open-interval sequence by layering rotated KT-spine templates, translating blocks per template, and optionally interleaving/reversing order; adds classic connectors (left/right/cross) and optional long-range connectors; introduces three micro-phases (A–C) that inject long-range caps and windowed micro-blocks with diversified sampling and interleaving, all governed by a CAP guard (9800) to cap total intervals; seeds and translations derive from the current span, starting from a single unit interval.
- **Performance**: Competitive_ratio ~1.92 with 9800 intervals produced, i.e., the process saturates the CAP while delivering the full interval set.
- **Feedback**: The approach is modular and multi-scale, using KT-spine expansion plus staged micro-augmentations to boost FirstFit pressure; while powerful, the heuristic choices are highly tailored and somewhat brittle to parameter shifts (seed_count, CAP) and window selections, suggesting value in parameterization and clearer empirical analysis.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 209 - Patch Name final_round_cross4_and_offset_microseed - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic KT-style spine with rotating templates**  
- **Implementation**: Builds a deterministic KT-like spine by evolving a set of open intervals T through staged rounds. It caps growth at CAP=9800, uses a four-template rotating bank, supports interleaving and parity-based reversal, and appends deterministic connectors. A micro-phase inserts small, windowed blocks and long connectors near the tail, followed by up to two micro-rounds with alt windows to enrich mixing, all in a fully deterministic, interval-translation framework.  
- **Performance**: The run returns the capped 9800 intervals, with metrics indicating a competitive_ratio ~2.18 and a combined score of 0.00; CAP-driven guarding ensures predictable memory and time behavior.  
- **Feedback**: The implementation combines multiple orthogonal diversification mechanisms (rotating templates, interleaving, parity flips, and micro-phases) under a strict capacity bound, yielding a robust, deterministic spine suitable for validation tests. The approach is clearly modular, though the multi-stage logic and numeric transforms may warrant careful tuning if different CAP targets or density goals are desired.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 211 - Patch Name increase_micro_iterations - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-Style Spinal Interval Evolver with Connectors**
- **Implementation**: Deterministic interval builder seeded with (0,1) that grows via KT-like spines using four strong-start templates and per-round block translations. It caps growth with CAP=9800 (plus a 24-tail reserve), interleaves and/or reverses blocks across rounds, and appends explicit connectors (_append_connectors) to mix colors. A staged approach includes Stage 1 KT spine construction, a micro-phase tail insertion to boost mixing, and a final cross-scale connector layer with cross4 patterns; micro rounds use delta-scaled windows and alternating block ordering to preserve determinism while expanding coverage.
- **Performance**: Produces 9785 intervals (within CAP), with a competitive_ratio ~1.93 and a combined score of 0.00, indicating deterministic behavior and near-cap utilization without overflow.
- **Feedback**: The implementation effectively controls omega growth through capacity guards and tail connectors while leveraging rotating templates and parity-driven interleaving to enhance mixing. The multi-stage design (spine, micro-phases, cross-scale connectors) balances expansion and coupling, though the code is quite dense and relies on many moving parts (phases, windows, and toggles) which may hinder readability and tunability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 212 - Patch Name reserve_cross4_layer - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT Spine Interval Evolver with Micro-Phases**
- **Implementation**: Implements construct_intervals with CAP=9800, using deterministic KT-spine templates rotated to diversify coupling; starts with seed-derived base intervals, then runs six spine rounds with interleaving/reversals, followed by two micro-phase rounds that build windowed blocks and connectors, all guarded by CAP clamps for stability.
- **Performance**: Combined score 2.10, competitive_ratio 2.33, with 9800 intervals generated (sample shown).
- **Feedback**: Demonstrates a reproducible, deterministic interval-construction strategy leveraging KT-spine ideas and structured micro-windows to bound omega; the implementation is intricate but validated to pass tests, though maintainability could benefit from modularization or clearer abstractions.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 213 - Patch Name kt_spine_dual_micro_v2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Rotating KT Spine Interval Generator**
- **Implementation**: Builds a rotating-template KT spine by translating four template blocks (from template_bank or a fixed spine_starts set), optionally interleaving or reversing blocks, and appending classic connectors. It seeds with (0,1), uses a span helper to normalize translations, and applies micro-phases that add long-range caps and delta-based windows, all guarded by CAP=9800 to keep total intervals under 10000.
- **Performance**: Produces 9800 intervals (CAP reached); competitive_ratio ~ 1.92 with a combined score of 0.00.
- **Feedback**: The modular staging (stage1 rotation, micro-phase A/B, and phase2 iterations) yields dense interval coverage under a strict budget, but the heavy parameterization and capacity-driven exits increase complexity; clearer documentation of parameter effects and edge-case handling would aid maintainability and reproducibility.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 214 - Patch Name second_micro_phase_and_cross4 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: KT-style Interleaving Spine Builder**
- **Implementation**: Builds a deterministic spine of open intervals by iteratively translating a current interval list T through four strong-start templates (rotatable), with optional interleaving and reversal per round; after each round it appends fixed connectors and then, if under a CAP budget, performs a two-phase micro-phase that adds translated micro-blocks within fractional windows, all guarded by a capacity constant (CAP) to bound total intervals.
- **Performance**: Reported metrics show a large interval set (around 10k+ intervals) and a competitive_ratio of ~1.92, but the run is labeled incorrect and does not pass all validation tests, indicating the guards or output validity are not consistently enforced.
- **Feedback**: The CAP-based growth control appears fragile (results exceed intended cap in practice), and there are signs of output validity issues (e.g., truncated/ill-formed interval lines); recommend tightening capacity checks, adding explicit post-generation length validation, and simplifying the micro-phase to ensure deterministic, test-passing behavior with clearer boundaries.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 215 - Patch Name add_cross4_connectors - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: KT-Backbone FirstFit Interval Builder**
- **Implementation**: Builds a deterministic sequence of open intervals to maximize colors used by FirstFit per the KT backbone. Stage 1 uses a fixed start pattern (2,6,10,14) to form blocks and connectors; Stage 2 performs two delta2-scale micro-rounds with thinning seeds, parity-based block reversal, interleaving across four blocks, and additional deterministic connectors plus sparse caps. A CAP guard (9800 intervals) restricts total size; all steps are deterministic to preserve the KT backbone and ensure reproducibility.
- **Performance**: Competitive ratio 2.20 with 9676 intervals (optimum reported as 10); validation confirms correctness and adherence to the capacity constraint.
- **Feedback**: The implementation successfully reproduces the KT backbone while achieving a stable, reproducible FirstFit score under the cap. The two-stage design balances global structure and local refinements, though the approach sits near capacity; future work could explore alternate starts or budget tuning to further reduce interval count or improve the ratio.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 216 - Patch Name add-optional-alt-microphase - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Deterministic KT Spine with Micro-Phases**
- **Implementation**: Builds a deterministic KT-like interval spine by iteratively expanding a set T under a fixed CAP (9800). It uses a BASE_SEED and a derive_seed function to inject deterministic jitter, parity, and template index, rotating among four start templates. Stage 1 grows T in rounds (interleaving and optional reversal) with four translated blocks and a set of connectors; Stage 2 adds micro-phases (A and B) with windowed, delta-driven micro-blocks and deterministic cross-connectors, then a final long-range cross4 layer, all CAP-gated and with a tail-insertion heuristic to boost mixing. The result is returned as a list of open intervals (l, r) in a specific generation order.
- **Performance**: Evaluator reports a zero objective score (Combined score: 0.00) with a competitive_ratio of 1.92 and 10921 intervals observed in the run excerpt; the reported output appears to exceed CAP-style constraints and is flagged as incorrect, failing validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The implementation is complex and brittle with aggressive CAP management and many deterministic transforms that can produce large, non-monotone, or constraint-violating outputs. Validation tests likely fail due to exceeding the intended interval cap, potential ordering/disjointness assumptions, and lack of guarantees about FF-presentation ordering. Suggested fixes include enforcing strict CAP adherence, ensuring output intervals satisfy monotonicity/disjointness constraints, and adding targeted tests for boundary cases, ordering, and reproducibility across parameter choices.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 217 - Patch Name ff_spine_dual_micro_cross4 - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Builder with Micro-Windows**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of open integer intervals by iteratively weaving translated backbone blocks via four fixed templates, then augments with micro-windows seeded from existing blocks and guarded by a CAP; connectors are inserted to join blocks, and multiple parity-driven reordering schemes are used to mix order across rounds.
- **Performance**: Performance: Combined score 0.0; the program is incorrect and does not pass validation tests.
- **Feedback**: The implementation uses layered heuristics (backbone weaving, parity mixing, and micro-windows with pin-mode) without an explicit objective evaluation of FirstFit vs. omega, making outcomes brittle; CAP-based termination and complex interleaving likely contribute to validation failures.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 218 - Patch Name window_weave_dual_micro - Correct Program: False

**Program Name: Evolve-Block Interval Construction for FirstFit**
- **Implementation**: Builds a long sequence of open intervals by seeding with unit intervals, then performing six rounds that translate and interleave blocks using a rotating template_bank. Micro-phases A–D extend the interval set with carefully positioned caps, micro-rounds, and cross-scale connectors, all guarded by CAP = 9800 to keep the total count under 10000; returns the final interval list.
- **Performance**: Evaluation reports a competitive_ratio of 1.79 with 9787 intervals generated (near CAP), and validation notes the program is correct and passes tests.
- **Feedback**: The approach favorably trades breadth of color usage for adherence to an omega cap via layered, deterministic patterning and interleaving; strong cross-block mixing and multiple micro-phases help push FirstFit colors while controlling growth, though the method is complex and tightly coupled to CAP and seed strategy, which may affect flexibility and maintainability.

**Program Name: KT Spine Interval Evolver**
- **Implementation**: Builds a sequence of translated interval blocks using _span_delta, interleaving/ordering options, and a set of connectors via _append_connectors; runs six KT-like rounds with rotated start templates and parity-based assembly, then injects deterministic micro-rounds and long-range cross4 connections, finally trimming to CAP=9800 and optionally adding parabolic caps.

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Below is a synthesis of concrete patterns, outcomes, and implementation details drawn from the evaluated programs, with emphasis on the current best (EVOLVE-BLOCK-START) and how it compares to others.

Successful Algorithmic Patterns

- CAP-first backbone with a guarded two-stage workflow
  - The strongest performers saturate CAP (9800 intervals) and then leverage a second-stage micro-phase that is explicitly gated to avoid overgrowth. EVOLVE-BLOCK-START (Generation 190) epitomizes this: six spine rounds to build the backbone, followed by a CAP-gated micro-phase that only runs if len(T) < CAP - 16. This two-stage, CAP-aware discipline consistently yields high scores (2.30) when the cap is saturated.
  - Other high-score variants with the same CAP discipline and two-stage logic include KT-spine FirstFit interval generator (Generation 195) and Deterministic KT Spine with Rotating Templates (Generation 208), both producing 9800 intervals and a 2.30 score.

- Deterministic backbone built from rotating templates plus fixed connectors
  - Rotating four-template backbone drives diverse but predictable growth. EVOLVE-BLOCK-START rotates among four templates per round, builds four translated blocks, and appends deterministic connectors. The rotating-template approach is a core contributor to achieving near-CAP saturation without violating CAP, supporting stable, reproducible high scores (2.30 when CAP is reached).
  - This pattern is echoed in Generation 208 (Rotating Templates variant) and Gen 195 (two-stage spine with rotating templates) as effective configurations.

- Seed-based micro-phases anchored to the backbone with four windowed blocks
  - A recurring, effective motif is a seed from the backbone used to construct a four-window micro-phase. The windows are fixed fractions of the global span (approximately 0.12–0.22, 0.35–0.45, 0.58–0.68, 0.80–0.90). The four translated blocks are created from a backbone seed, interleaved to maximize FirstFit pressure, and joined with deterministic connectors. This pattern is central to the top performers (e.g., EVOLVE-BLOCK-START, Gen 191, Gen 195, Gen 208).
  - Deterministic connectors linking micro-blocks prevent uncontrolled omega growth while maintaining dense FF pressure.

- Deterministic cross-scale connectors and delta-based translations
  - Connectors are computed deterministically from the spine starts and a delta derived from the current backbone span (lo/hi). Examples include connectors like ((s0 - 1) * delta, (s1 - 1) * delta) and related fractional-spread pairs. This ensures predictable coupling across blocks and scales, contributing to reproducible high-density outputs without overrun.

- Reproducibility through fixed seeds and parameter discipline
  - Best-performing variants rely on fixed seeds and fixed templates. The deterministic, queue-like progression (six spine rounds followed by capacity-aware micro-phases) yields stable results across parameter choices and tests, aligning with the observed high scores when CAP is saturated.

Ineffective Approaches

- Rotation without a strong backbone or CAP discipline
  - Gen 134 (rotating_spine_templates) showed poor performance (~2.71) when rotation was used without a coherent backbone and explicit CAP guards. This confirms that rotation alone is insufficient; CAP discipline and a stable backbone are essential for high FF pressure under CAP.

- Multi-seed strategies that risk unbounded growth
  - Gen 136 reported reliability issues with multiple seeds causing early, unbounded growth when CAP discipline is not tight. Without explicit CAP bounds and post-generation checks, growth can exceed intended budgets and destabilize results.

- Fragile CAP management leading to invalid outputs
  - Gen 215 (KT-style Interleaving Spine Builder) produced a run labeled incorrect, with CAP-related guards not consistently enforcing validity (output intervals sometimes ill-formed or truncated). This underscores that CAP checks must be robust and pair with strict post-generation validation.

- Over-parameterization / brittle parameterization causing misbehavior
  - Gen 207/209-type variants show that expanding micro-phase complexity without robust gating can degrade robustness or reproducibility. High parameter density without strong CAP guards risks miscounts or inconsistent ordering.

- Patch variants labeled incorrect or invalid
  - Gen 217 and Gen 218 (and related patches) are marked false/incorrect in the summaries, illustrating that certain implementation styles (especially when CAP and validation criteria are not properly met) fail to pass the evaluators’ tests.

Implementation Insights

- CAP-driven, two-stage backbone design
  - The key to top performance is a backbone expanded through six spine rounds under a CAP=9800 bound, with a second-stage micro-phase only applied when there is room (len(T) < CAP - 16). This gating preserves CAP while allowing densification when possible.

- Four-template rotating backbone with deterministic connectors
  - The backbone uses four templates rotated across rounds, producing diverse yet predictable block fusions. The apply_round routine (translate-blocks by delta derived from the current T span, optionally interleaving) underpins this stable growth. Deterministic connectors are appended each round to maintain coupling without blow-up.

- Seeded, windowed micro-phases
  - Micro-phases are seeded from backbone content and realized as four windowed blocks across fixed global span fractions. This deterministic seeding and windowing is responsible for injecting mixing pressure while respecting the total CAP.

- Delta-based translations and deterministic cross-scale links
  - Delta is defined as hi - lo; translations of blocks and the deterministic connectors tie blocks across scales in a predictable manner, enabling dense FF pressure without violating monotonicity or disjointness assumptions.

- Validation-driven constraints and monotonicity safeguards
  - The architecture includes explicit CAP checks (e.g., CAP gating, near-CAP short-circuit in Stage 2) and boundary trimming (trim to CAP). These safeguards appear critical to achieving the high, stable scores in most top variants.

- Observed impact of micro-phase complexity
  - While two-stage designs with four-window micro-phases tend to perform well (e.g., EVOLVE-BLOCK-START, Gen 195, Gen 208), injecting more micro-phases or chaotic interleaving without robust CAP checks often yields lower scores or invalid results (e.g., Gen 214’s 1.92 despite hitting CAP).

Performance Analysis

- Score distribution and CAP saturation
  - The highest scores (2.30) align with saturated CAP runs (9800 intervals). EVOLVE-BLOCK-START delivers 9800 intervals with a 2.30 score; KT-spine FirstFit (Gen 195) and Deterministic KT Spine with Rotating Templates (Gen 208) reach the same CAP and score, indicating the CAP-saturated regime is the sweet spot for top performance.
  - Near-CAP runs also produce strong results when the micro-phase is well-structured (e.g., Gen 191 with 9785 intervals and 2.30). However, saturation generally yields the maximum observed score in this set.

- Variation across backbone and micro-phase designs
  - Gen 214 (Rotating KT Spine with micro-phases) reaches CAP but scores only 1.92, suggesting that not all micro-phase configurations scale equally with CAP. The particular choice of micro-phase fractions, connectors, and seed strategy matters as much as CAP saturation itself.
  - Gen 216 (KT-Backbone FirstFit) saturates near CAP (9676 intervals) but achieves 2.20, showing that approaching CAP is not a sole predictor of peak score; the precise micro-phase structure and sequencing influence the outcome.

- Reliability vs complexity trade-offs
  - The most successful patterns combine a compact backbone (six spine rounds) with a well-contained micro-phase (four-window seeds) and deterministic connectors. This yields both high performance and reproducibility. In contrast, heavily parameterized, interleaving-rich designs without tight CAP gating tend to produce lower scores or validation issues (e.g., Gen 215, Gen 214’s variability).

- Concrete evidence anchors
  - Current Best: EVOLVE-BLOCK-START (Generation 190) — 9800 intervals; score 2.30; six backbone rounds; four-window micro-phase; CAP-first gating; validated as correct.
  - Other strong performers with CAP saturation and high scores: KT-spine FirstFit (Gen 195), Deterministic KT Spine with Rotating Templates (Gen 208) — both 9800 intervals, 2.30.
  - Near-CAP but lower scores with different micro-phase configurations: Gen 191 (9785 intervals, 2.30) and Gen 214 (9800 intervals, 1.92) illustrating that micro-phase design details are critical to achieving peak scores even when CAP is saturated.
  - Lower or unstable results in rotation-only or multi-seed approaches: Gen 134 (2.71, poor CAP discipline), Gen 136 (reliability issues with multiple seeds), Gen 215 (incorrect/fragile CAP guards).

In summary, the current best program (EVOLVE-BLOCK-START) demonstrates the most effective combination observed: a CAP-aware backbone built from a rotating four-template bank, a deterministic four-window micro-phase seeded from the backbone, and explicit governance that gates the second stage to avoid omega overgrowth. High scores correlate strongly with saturating CAP and employing a compact, deterministic backbone-plus-seeded micro-phase design. Variants achieving similar CAP saturation can achieve top scores when their micro-phase coupling and connectors are carefully chosen; when that coupling is poorly chosen or CAP guards are weak, performance degrades or validity issues arise. The overarching pattern—CAP discipline combined with a seeded, deterministic micro-phase built atop a rotating backbone—consistently distinguishes the best results from the rest.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1) Add a second guarded micro-phase with a distinct fixed window set seeded from the backbone
- Build on the proven four-window micro-phase approach by introducing a second micro-phase after the primary delta2 stage, using a new fixed window set (e.g., [(0.05, 0.15), (0.28, 0.38), (0.60, 0.70), (0.82, 0.92)]) seeded deterministically from the backbone (seed2 = f(spine_seed, stage_index)). Gate this micro-phase with the same CAP discipline (stop if len(T) >= CAP - 16) so it stays within CAP. This leverages the strong two-stage, CAP-aware pattern and should push FirstFit pressure higher without overgrowth.

2) Introduce a long-range cross4 connector layer for stronger cross-scale coupling
- Add a fourth deterministic connector set that ties blocks across distant spans (roughly 4–6 delta-sized intervals apart), computed from fixed offsets along the global span and applied after the backbone and micro-phases. Ensure these connectors are CAP-gated and truncated to CAP, so they enrich cross-scale interactions without breaking the CAP bound. This mirrors the success of deterministic connectors in stabilizing high FF pressure while expanding cross-scale mixing.

3) Harden deterministic per-round seed derivation using a global BASE_SEED
- Replace any implicit randomness with a single global BASE_SEED and a deterministic function of (BASE_SEED, round_index) to derive: (a) template index, (b) window placements, and (c) small translations for that round. This ensures every mutation uses identical seeds across runs, boosting reproducibility and preserving the CAP-conscious, high-FF behavior that characterizes EVOLVE-BLOCK-START and related top variants.

4) Explore spine growth density with a K multiplier in {1, 2}
- Introduce a K parameter to scale backbone growth density: when K=2, increase the per-round block count or the per-round delta to densify the spine, while recomputing CAP checks so the total interval count stays within CAP. This directly extends the compact, six-round backbone pattern and can raise FF pressure if the CAP gates remain robust, offering a controlled test of density vs. CAP.

5) Enforce parity-based interleaving across spine rounds and micro-phases
- Implement a deterministic parity rule: on even spine rounds, interleave the four translated blocks to maximize cross-block mixing; on odd rounds, append blocks sequentially. Apply the same parity logic to any micro-phases. This preserves reproducibility while potentially boosting FF pressure by creating more balanced mixing across scales, aligning with the observed benefit of structured diversification in CAP-aware designs.
