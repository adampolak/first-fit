 def construct_intervals(rounds=3):
   """
-  Construct a sequence of intervals of real line,
-  in the order in which they are presented to FirstFit,
-  so that it tends to maximize the number of colors used by FirstFit
-  divided by the maximum number of intervals that cover a single point
-  through a recursive wave construction.
+  Fractal-like multi-scale wave construction.
+  Produces a deterministic sequence of intervals (open) for FirstFit.
 
-  The construction generalizes the two-round pattern used in Figure 4 of
-  https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00192 to a multi-round recursive expansion.
+  Strategy overview:
+  - Seed with four disjoint unit intervals to establish a small omega spine.
+  - In each round, generate multiple translated copies (blocks) of the current T
+    at fixed offsets (offsets grow with round) to create multi-wave overlap.
+  - Interleave blocks to promote color diversity; add short bridging intervals
+    and a gadget set to pressure color usage without inflating omega.
+  - Normalize to non-negative integers and clamp to a reasonable maximum.
+  Returns:
+    List of (l, r) pairs representing open intervals.
