   Deterministic KT-style spine with a safeguarded two-phase scaffold.
 
   Parameters:
     rounds (int): main expansion depth; near 6 yields ~9556 intervals for a single-seed KT spine.
     rotate_starts (bool): available but disabled in the safeguarded spine mode.
     reverse_block_parity (bool): available but disabled in the safeguarded spine mode.
     interleave_blocks (bool): available but disabled in the safeguarded spine mode.
     phase2_iters (int): requested micro iterations; actual application is strictly capacity- and safety-gated.
