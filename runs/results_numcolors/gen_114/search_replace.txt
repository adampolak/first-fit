micro_parity_cross3
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Relax the capacity guard to allow a thin micro-phase and replace the window-based micro builder with a two-round, delta2-scale micro-extension that uses the classic four-start template, parity interleaving, and a long-range cross3 connector. This follows the strongest prior performer pattern: keep the KT spine sequential to control omega, then add two carefully budgeted micro rounds built from a thin seed, interleaved across four translated blocks, and add sparse caps/connectors. This design increases FirstFit pressure while keeping the clique number modest, targeting improved combined score beyond the baseline 6-round KT spine.
