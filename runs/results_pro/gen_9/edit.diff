 def construct_intervals():
   """
   Construct a sequence of intervals of real line,
   in the order in which they are presented to FirstFit,
   so that it maximizes the number of colors used by FirstFit
   divided by the maximum number of intervals that cover a single point
 
   This implementation follows the recursive "cap" construction
   inspired by Figure 4 in https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00192 and
   increases the recursion depth to amplify the FF/omega ratio.
