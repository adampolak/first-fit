 def construct_intervals():
   """
-  Construct a sequence of intervals of real line,
-  in the order in which they are presented to FirstFit,
-  so that it maximizes the number of colors used by FirstFit
-  divided by the maximum number of intervals that cover a single point
-  
-  The initial implementation uses the construction from
-  Figure 4 in https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00192
-  
+  Construct a sequence of intervals on the real line presented to FirstFit,
+  based on the Figure 4 gadget from https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00192,
+  iterated three times to force FirstFit to use many colors while
+  the clique number (optimum) remains 3.
   Returns:
-    intervals: list of tuples, each tuple (l, r) represents an open interval from l to r
+    intervals: list of tuples (l, r) representing open intervals.
