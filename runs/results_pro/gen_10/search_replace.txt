increase_depth_to_7
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
We keep the proven recursive cap construction but push the recursion one level deeper. Empirically for this pattern, FirstFit uses about 3*depth+1 colors while the clique number grows about depth+1, so the ratio (3*depth+1)/(depth+1) increases with depth and approaches 3. Moving from depth=4 (ratio ≈ 2.60) to depth=7 should raise the ratio to roughly 22/8 = 2.75, improving the combined score without changing the structural guarantees of the construction. This is a targeted, low‑risk modification consistent with the recursive strategy and the literature-inspired cap approach.
