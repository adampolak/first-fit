<NAME>pattern_diversity_twoseed</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Proposes two coordinated improvements to the cap-based interval construction to increase FirstFit color usage while keeping the clique (omega) controlled:
- Introduce a second spine seed in the initial template to diversify growth paths (two disjoint seeds). This helps FF encounter more opportunities to introduce new colors without inflating omega.
- Expand the pattern banks (START_SETS and BRIDGE_SETS) with an additional pattern in each, increasing structural variety across depths. This disrupts fixed symmetries and can push FF to use more colors.
The changes are deterministic (no randomness) and remain compatible with the existing SCALING_LIST/gamma schedule.
