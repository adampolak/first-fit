expand_gamma_list
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Increase variation in the scaling schedule to break periodic symmetry. By appending an additional gamma factor (1.05) to SCALING_LIST, the recursion will use a longer deterministic cycle of span multipliers, which can amplify FirstFit color growth without increasing the clique.

seed_diversification
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Introduce a second disjoint spine interval at the start to diversify the recursive growth. Having two non-overlapping seed intervals will create a "double spine," effectively doubling the interaction complexity in subsequent layers and potentially forcing FirstFit to use more colors while preserving a small clique number.
