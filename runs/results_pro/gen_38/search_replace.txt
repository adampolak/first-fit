depth_cycle_env
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Introduce environment-driven depth cycling within the cap-construction. When depth is not provided, choose between depth=4 and depth=5 based on an environment seed (EVO_DEPTH_SEED) to explore deeper expansions deterministically. Falls back safely to depth=4 if the env var is absent or invalid.

  # Allow explicit depth control to explore smarter configurations.

<NAME>
three_seed_expansion
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Increase the number of spine (seed) intervals from two to three to boost layout diversity and provide more independent growth paths for the recursive cap-construction. This aims to create more opportunities for FirstFit to be forced into new colors while keeping omega bounded.
