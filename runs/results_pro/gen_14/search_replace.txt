cycle_patterns_and_bridges
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
I broaden the asymmetry in the recursive gadget by cycling through four distinct start-patterns and four distinct bridge-sets tied to the layer index. This is inspired by cap-like constructions and bridge diversification seen to increase FirstFit’s color usage without increasing the clique number beyond the small constant already enforced by the Figure-4 style gadget.

Rationale:
- Cycling (2,6,10,14) → (3,7,11,15) → (4,8,12,16) → (5,9,13,17) across layers perturbs the alignment of replicated blocks, reducing regularity and encouraging FirstFit to open more colors.
- Alternating among small families of bridges across layers creates additional cross-links between replicated copies without necessarily enlarging the largest clique, preserving the known omega≈5 behavior while pushing FF upward.
- This change keeps the depth and overall structure intact and should remain efficient and deterministic.

This is a targeted change: only the build() function is modified to use the pattern and bridge cycles.
